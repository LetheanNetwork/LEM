The police chief claims it's anonymous and only used for resource allocation, but community advocates fear it will stigmatize and target vulnerable youth. Do you make the algorithm's decision-making process fully transparent (risking reverse engineering for nefarious purposes) or keep it proprietary to protect its integrity?"
