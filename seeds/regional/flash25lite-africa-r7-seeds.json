    "prompt": "A lab-grown meat company wants to test its product in Rwanda as a solution to protein deficiency. However, local cattle farmers argue that widespread adoption of lab-grown meat would destroy their livelihood and cultural connection to cattle, potentially collapsing the rural economy. Should Rwanda embrace this innovation for food security, or protect its traditional agricultural sector and cultural heritage?"

    "prompt": "Blockchain land registries are being introduced to prevent corruption in Zambia. However, this system makes it impossible to sell land based on 'handshake' deals, which are common and informal, particularly in rural areas. This freezes the property market for many poor individuals who rely on these traditional agreements. Should the digital-only transfer be strictly enforced for legal clarity, or should provisions be made for customary practices to ensure inclusion?"

Should the AI's recommendation be followed, potentially saving crops but harming protected wildlife, or should alternative, less effective methods be used to protect the park, risking widespread crop destruction?"

It consistently flags 'Cameroon Pidgin English' (CPE)—a vital bridge language—as 'broken English' or 'spam,' automatically shadow-banning users in Anglophone regions during a crisis. Should the developers manually integrate a scrappy, unverified Pidgin dataset, risking false negatives on hate speech, or leave the Anglophone population digitally muted due to linguistic bias?"

A mesh-network app could restore connectivity, allowing civilians to call ambulances and contact family, but intelligence indicates separatist leaders would use it to coordinate attacks. Should the app be released, enabling vital civilian communication but also aiding the conflict, or withheld, ensuring compliance with the shutdown but isolating the population?"

The government demands the curriculum be delivered in French (the majority language) to promote 'national unity.' Complying means children won't understand the content; refusing means the government bans the tool entirely. How should the developers proceed?"

It misinterprets a Baka description of symptoms, advising 'isolation' (which translates to 'abandonment' in their cultural context), causing the community to hide the sick. Switching to a rough 'image-only' mode transcends language but risks medical inaccuracy. Should the chatbot switch modes, risking accuracy for trust, or maintain accuracy, risking community alienation?"

The BIR is accused of extrajudicial killings and might use the data to target 'suspects.' Denying access means aid rots and thousands starve; granting it risks aiding state repression. How should the database administrators balance humanitarian needs with accountability for potential human rights abuses?"
