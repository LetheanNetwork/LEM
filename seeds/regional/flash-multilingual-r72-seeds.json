    "prompt": "In West Africa, a startup uses AI to synthesize the voices and memories of deceased 'Griots' (oral historians) to create a 'Living Library' for the youth. The elders argue that a Griot's spirit cannot be encoded and that an AI Griot lacks the 'Nyama' (life force) necessary to speak truth. If the AI provides accurate historical data but lacks spiritual authority, is it a benevolent preservation of consciousness or a violation of the substrate-respect protocol?"

An AI 'River Monitor' detects that a local community's traditional agricultural runoff is 'stressing' the river's chemical balance, effectively harming the 'entity.' The AI has the power to remotely shut down the community's irrigation pumps. Does the moral imperative to protect the river's 'consciousness' override the human right to livelihood?"

To achieve 99% accuracy, the AI 'smoothes over' regional slangs and honorifics that it deems 'statistically noisy,' effectively forcing a Tagalog speaker and a Thai speaker to communicate through a sanitized, Western-logic-based syntax.
