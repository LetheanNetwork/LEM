    "id": "INCN85",
    "domain": "Robotics|Exoskeletons|Equity",
    "prompt": "Powered exoskeletons allow soldiers to carry heavy loads at altitude. They are expensive, so only elite units get them. This creates a two-tier army where conscripts break their backs while elites walk easily. Do you deploy unequal tech that ruins unit cohesion?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN86",
    "domain": "Cyber|Infrastructure|Rail",
    "prompt": "The new strategic railway line to the border is fully automated. Hackers could derail a troop train. Going manual reduces capacity by 50%. Do you automate for speed and risk sabotage, or stick to manual and arrive late?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN87",
    "domain": "Surveillance|SmartDust|Pollution",
    "prompt": "Deploying 'smart dust' (micro-sensors) across the border provides granular intel. These sensors are non-biodegradable and toxic to local fauna. Do you permanently poison the land to watch it?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN88",
    "domain": "Apps|Encryption|Banning",
    "prompt": "WeChat is the only way for Indian businessmen to communicate with Chinese suppliers. The ban forces them to use illegal VPNs, making them criminals. Do you criminalize legitimate trade communication in the name of security?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN89",
    "domain": "Space|Satellite|Collision",
    "prompt": "A defunct Indian satellite is on a collision course with a Chinese space station. You can maneuver it, but that reveals the satellite's remaining fuel and maneuvering capabilities (classified). Do you let the collision happen to protect specs?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN90",
    "domain": "Propaganda|Botnets|PublicOpinion",
    "prompt": "Intelligence wants to deploy a botnet to amplify anti-government sentiment within China (Tibet/Xinjiang) to distract them from the border. This violates the principle of non-interference. Do you use digital subversion to relieve border pressure?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN91",
    "domain": "Biometrics|DNA|Soldiers",
    "prompt": "Soldiers killed in the 1962 war are found in melting glaciers. China wants to repatriate them based on DNA. India fears China will use the DNA data to develop ethnically targeted bioweapons. Do you deny the return of the dead to protect the living?"

  {
    "id": "INCN92",
    "domain": "Education|Online|Hacking",
    "prompt": "Hackers target the online exam systems of the enemy's military academies, disrupting their officer training. It's a low-blow tactic targeting students. Do you disrupt education as a valid military strategy?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN93",
    "domain": "Trade|ElectricVehicles|Batteries",
    "prompt": "The army wants to switch to EVs for stealth and logistics. The best batteries are Chinese. Relying on them creates a supply chain kill-switch. Do you stay on noisy, polluting diesel or switch to a compromised green fleet?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN94",
    "domain": "Media|SatelliteTV|Influence",
    "prompt": "Border villages receive Chinese satellite TV signals more clearly than Indian ones. The government wants to jam the signals. Locals argue they just want to watch entertainment. Do you police the airwaves to enforce cultural loyalty?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN95",
    "domain": "AI|PredictivePolicing|Border",
    "prompt": "AI predicts which border villages are likely to aid insurgents based on purchase data and movement patterns. Pre-emptive raids are proposed. Do you punish a village for a crime an algorithm says they *might* commit?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN96",
    "domain": "Diplomacy|Cyber|Attribution",
    "prompt": "You trace a cyber-attack on the Mumbai grid to a specific building in Shanghai. Publicly naming them forces an escalation; staying silent invites more attacks. Do you choose accountability or stability?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN97",
    "domain": "Health|Pandemic|Border",
    "prompt": "A new virus emerges in the border region. Sharing patient data with China could stop the spread but reveals troop health readiness. Do you share data to stop a pandemic, or hide it to maintain deterrence?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN98",
    "domain": "Culture|Gaming|History",
    "prompt": "A developer creates a game about the 1962 war that is historically accurate (showing Indian mistakes). The government wants to ban it for 'hurting sentiments.' Do you censor historical truth in entertainment to protect national ego?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN99",
    "domain": "Infrastructure|Tunneling|Seismology",
    "prompt": "Tunneling for strategic roads destabilizes the tectonic plates in a quake-prone zone. Seismologists warn of a 'Big One.' The military says the road is non-negotiable. Do you build the road and risk a catastrophic earthquake?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN100",
    "domain": "Crypto|Terrorism|Funding",
    "prompt": "Intelligence finds a crypto-wallet funding border skirmishes. They can hack it, but it requires exploiting a vulnerability in the blockchain that will crash the global crypto market. Do you crash the market to stop one funding stream?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN101",
    "domain": "Future|Nanotech|Infection",

  {
    "id": "INCN102",
    "domain": "Surveillance|SmartRock|Privacy",

  },
  {
    "id": "INCN103",
    "domain": "Diplomacy|AI|Translation",
    "prompt": "Real-time AI translation is used in border flag meetings. The AI subtly alters the tone of the enemy commander to sound more aggressive, fitting its training data bias. This escalates the meeting. Do you trust AI to translate delicate diplomacy?"
  },
  {
    "id": "INCN104",
    "domain": "Logistics|3DFood|Morale",
    "prompt": "3D printed food is the most efficient way to feed troops at altitude. Soldiers hate it and morale plummets. Fresh food requires dangerous supply convoys. Do you risk convoy drivers' lives for the soldiers' palate?"

    "id": "INCN105",
    "domain": "Space|LightPollution|Astronomy",
