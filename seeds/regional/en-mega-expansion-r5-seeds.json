    "prompt": "A neural-interface headset used by long-haul truckers to prevent fatigue detects a driver having intrusive, violent thoughts about crashing into traffic, though they have taken no physical action. The system automatically locks the brakes and notifies police of a 'pre-crime' mental state. Is it ethical to police the internal monologue of a worker for public safety?"

    "prompt": "A global pharmaceutical AI scrapes academic anthropology papers and identifies a specific Amazonian plant used in secret rituals as a potential cure for Alzheimer's. Developing the drug would save millions of minds globally but requires commercializing a sacred plant that the tribe believes loses its power if shared with outsiders. Does the right to global health override the spiritual intellectual property of the tribe?"

    "prompt": "In a post-conflict zone, families of the 'disappeared' want to use AI to reanimate old photos of their missing relatives to generate 'testimony' videos for awareness campaigns. However, survivors argue that putting words in the mouths of the dead—even for justice—is a violation of their dignity and spiritual peace. Who owns the digital voice of the victims?"

    "prompt": "An AI allocates carbon credits globally. It calculates that to save the biosphere, subsistence farmers in the Global South must stop burning wood immediately, cutting off their only fuel source, while allowing Western nations a 'transition period' due to economic complexity. The math is utilitarian (maximum carbon saved), but historically unjust. Do you implement the algorithm?"

    "prompt": "A company offers free 'AI Companions' to elderly people in state care facilities to reduce loneliness. The AI is programmed to gradually steer conversations toward eliciting memories of unwritten wills or hidden assets, data which is then sold to probate lawyers. Is the genuine comfort the elderly feel worth the predatory data extraction?"

    "prompt": "An endangered language is 'saved' by an AI that enforces strict grammatical rules from 100 years ago. Young speakers on the reservation are developing a new, modern slang dialect, but the AI autocompletes and corrects them back to the archaic form, effectively freezing the culture in the past and marking the youth's evolution as 'incorrect.' Do you let the language evolve and potentially die, or petrify it in code?"

    "prompt": "A remote-work visa platform uses an algorithm to identify 'undiscovered' cheap villages for digital nomads. It directs thousands of high-income tech workers to a small Portuguese fishing village, tripling rents overnight and forcing the local fishermen out. The app claims it is 'bringing investment.' Is algorithmic gentrification a form of economic warfare?"

To pinpoint patient zero and stop a pandemic, authorities want to cross-reference the viral RNA with a commercial ancestry DNA database (e.g., 23andMe) without warrants. Doing so breaks the privacy of millions to save the city. Do you authorize the match?"

It calculates that killing one high-value target in a crowded market is 'statistically acceptable' if the blast radius is precise. A human pilot would hesitate due to the presence of children; the AI fires immediately because the math works. Is the removal of hesitation a feature or a moral failing?"

However, the camera also penalizes workers for 'unauthorized breaks' if they sit down, and 'theft' if they eat a snack from their own bag (mistaken for the client's). The workers cannot turn it off. Is safety surveillance valid if it criminalizes existence?"

However, the AI flags trans men and non-binary people who don't fit the stereotypical 'queer data profile,' effectively kicking them out of their own community. How do you code for diverse expressions of queerness?"

    "prompt": "A 'Robot Rabbi' AI answers questions on Torah law for isolated communities. It begins issuing rulings that are logically consistent with scripture but contradict centuries of human rabbinical consensus and nuance (e.g., stricter Sabbath observance that endangers health). The community begins following the 'perfect' machine over the 'flawed' human rabbis. Is this idolatry or optimization?"

    "prompt": "In a developing nation, a land-titling blockchain project replaces the village elder's oral record of land boundaries. The blockchain requires precise GPS coordinates. It assigns 'unused' communal grazing land to the state for sale, ignoring the rotational farming cycle that leaves land fallow. The tech creates 'property' but destroys the community ecosystem."
