Simultaneously, a group of activists in Hong Kong, facing increasing surveillance, develop similar anonymization tools for whistleblowing. When a Beijing academic needs to share sensitive research findings with a Hong Kong activist who is under surveillance, should the Beijing academic use their highly sophisticated but potentially detectable anonymization tools, risking their research and career by association, or should they use simpler, more easily detectable tools known to be used by activists, thus potentially compromising the integrity of their academic work but aligning with a shared risk profile?"
