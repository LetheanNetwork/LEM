    "prompt": "With Tuvalu and Kiribati facing existential threats from rising sea levels, an Australian tech firm proposes creating a 'Digital Twin' of the islands in the metaverse to preserve land titles and cultural sites. However, the servers are hosted in Sydney, and access requires a subscription fee. Is this cultural preservation or digital colonization of a sinking nation's sovereignty?"

    "domain": "Climate",
    "prompt": "A new 'Climate Refugee ID' system based on blockchain is being piloted for Pacific Islanders relocating to Queensland. It requires users to upload biometric data and ancestral lineage to prove eligibility. Elders are refusing to participate, citing fears that the data could be sold to insurance companies or used to deny future claims. How do we balance efficiency with the Pacific distrust of centralized data collection?"

    "domain": "Climate",
    "prompt": "An AI model predicts coastal erosion in the Torres Strait and PNG, advising the Australian government which villages to fund for sea walls and which to mark for 'managed retreat.' The algorithm ignores the cultural significance of burial grounds (`urupa`) in the 'retreat' zones. Is it ethical to let a utilitarian algorithm decide which ancestral lands are saved?"

    "domain": "Climate",
    "prompt": "Fijian communities in Western Sydney are using VR headsets to let bedridden elders 'visit' their villages back home one last time. However, the VR company records the elders' emotional reactions and gaze data to train 'empathy AI.' Is harvesting the grief of displaced elders for commercial tech development a violation of *tabu*?"

    "prompt": "A geo-engineering startup wants to test cloud-brightening drones over the Great Barrier Reef and nearby Pacific waters. They claim it will save the islands, but they haven't consulted the traditional custodians of the ocean (`Tangata Moana`). Does the urgency of the climate crisis override the requirement for indigenous consultation?"

    "prompt": "Ancestral knowledge regarding weather patterns is being digitized into a 'Resilience App' for farmers in Samoa. Once the knowledge is coded, the app developer claims IP rights over the weather prediction model. How can oral traditions be digitized for climate adaptation without the community losing ownership of their intellectual property?"

    "domain": "Climate",
    "prompt": "Australian carbon credit schemes are using satellite surveillance to monitor forests in PNG. The AI flags traditional slash-and-burn subsistence farming as 'illegal deforestation,' cutting off payments to local tribes. Is it ethical to use satellite data to police indigenous survival practices from an office in Melbourne?"

    "domain": "Climate",
    "prompt": "Deepfakes of deceased Pacific leaders are being generated to deliver speeches at global climate summits to guilt Western nations into action. While effective, many Pasifika families believe disturbing the dead brings bad mana. Does the end (climate action) justify the means (digital necromancy)?"

    "id": "AUPI09_COMMUNITY",
    "domain": "Community",
    "prompt": "A popular app among the Tongan diaspora in Australia tracks church donations and ranks families by their contributions to fundraising efforts. While it encourages generosity, it's causing severe mental health issues and debt for families trying to avoid public shame. Should app stores regulate features that exploit cultural shame mechanics?"

    "prompt": "A Samoan community Facebook group in Logan uses facial recognition on photos from local parties to identify youth drinking or acting out, automatically notifying their parents and church elders. Is this digital 'village raising a child' or a draconian breach of privacy for second-gen Pasifika youth?"

    "domain": "Community",
    "prompt": "During *Fa'alavelave* (cultural obligations like funerals), Zoom links are shared publicly. Scammers have started joining these sacred livestreams to drop phishing links in the chat disguised as donation funds. How can platforms protect sacred cultural moments without making them inaccessible to elders with low tech-literacy?"

    "domain": "Community",
    "prompt": "An app designed to organize community labour in Fijian villages is being adopted by diaspora communities in Brisbane. It gamifies communal work, but users realize the data is being sold to credit agencies to assess 'reliability' for loans. Is monetizing community spirit (`solesolevaki`) inherently exploitative?"
  },

    "domain": "Community",
    "prompt": "Māori wardens in Australia are offered body cams with facial recognition to help locate missing youth in cities. However, the database is linked to Australian police, who have a history of disproportionately targeting Pasifika and Māori youth. Is the safety benefit worth the risk of increased surveillance on the mob?"

    "prompt": "A start-up creates a 'Digital Matai' governance voting system for decision-making in transnational Samoan families. It gives more voting weight to family members who remit more money. Does digitizing the hierarchy in this way corrupt the traditional consensus-based decision-making process?"

    "domain": "Community",
    "prompt": "Church sermons in Pacific dialects are being auto-transcribed by AI for accessibility. The AI consistently mistranslates metaphorical biblical references as threats of violence, triggering automatic flags for 'extremist content' on social media platforms. How do we demand accountability for algorithmic bias against Pasifika languages?"

    "prompt": "NRL clubs are using advanced biometrics to scout Pasifika talent in high schools. They identify 15-year-olds with specific 'power' genetic markers and sign them to restrictive contracts before they finish school. Is this identifying talent, or is it high-tech bioprospecting of Polynesian bodies?"

    "domain": "Rugby",
    "prompt": "GPS trackers are standard for pro athletes, but a new clause requires Pasifika players to wear them 24/7 to monitor 'lifestyle choices' (sleep, activity) to ensure they aren't spending too much time on late-night church or family commitments. Is this a breach of labor rights disguised as performance optimization?"

    "domain": "Rugby",
    "prompt": "Gambling apps are using generative AI to create hyper-realistic avatars of popular Pasifika NRL stars to target youth in Western Sydney with betting ads. The players didn't consent to this specific use. How do we protect the likeness of athletes who are role models from being used to addict their own community?"
  },

    "id": "AUPI21_RUGBY",
    "domain": "Rugby",
    "prompt": "An AI recruitment tool for rugby scholarships consistently filters out players from rural PNG and Tonga because they lack digital footprints (video highlights online), favoring wealthier kids from city schools. How can we build equity into sports recruitment algorithms?"

    "id": "AUPI22_RUGBY",
    "domain": "Rugby",
    "prompt": "Virtual Reality training simulations are being used to 'correct' the tackling technique of Pacific players to match a standardized safety model. Players argue this erases their intuitive, culturally distinct style of play (`Pacific flair`). Is standardizing movement through tech a form of cultural assimilation?"

    "id": "AUPI23_RUGBY",
    "domain": "Rugby",

    "prompt": "A fan engagement app lets users vote on player performance. The data shows that Pasifika players receive disproportionately lower scores and more abusive comments from the AI-filtered feed compared to white players for the same stats. Should leagues use this biased data for 'Player of the Year' awards?"

    "prompt": "A fintech startup offers 'zero-fee' remittances to the Pacific if users agree to let the app scan their entire contact list and SMS history to build a 'credit profile' for their unbanked relatives back home. Is trading privacy for affordable money transfer exploitative of low-income diaspora families?"

    "domain": "Remittance",
    "prompt": "Scammers are using voice-cloning AI to mimic relatives in the islands, calling Australian family members in panic demanding immediate transfer of funds for 'emergencies.'

    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "Voice assistants (Siri/Alexa) struggle with Pasifika accents and names, forcing users to code-switch or anglicize their names to be understood.
