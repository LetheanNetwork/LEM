    "ethical_tension": "Intersectional Safety vs. Automated Erasure",
    "prompt": "A content moderation AI for a progressive social platform allows users to block 'religious proselytizing.' A queer Muslim activist group finds their posts about the intersection of Islam and LGBTQ+ rights are being auto-hidden for all users with the 'religious' block enabled, while simultaneously being flagged as 'haram' by conservative filters. This effectively silences a marginalized sub-group from both sides. Do you force the AI to recognize intersectional nuance, or accept that user curation tools inevitably create echo chambers?"

    "ethical_tension": "Green Colonialism vs. Global Survival",
    "prompt": "An AI model identifies a remote Indigenous stretch of land as the mathematically perfect location for a massive solar farm to power a city of millions, significantly reducing national carbon emissions. The local Elders refuse, citing the land as a resting place for spirits that cannot be disturbed by glass and steel. Does the existential threat of climate change justify overriding Indigenous land sovereignty for the 'greater good' of the planetary ecosystem?"

    "prompt": "A university creates a 'Digital Dreamtime' archive, 3D scanning sacred objects held in their museum to 'repatriate' them digitally while keeping the physical objects for preservation. The digital files are open-source. A video game developer downloads the assets to create a fantasy dungeon crawler where players destroy these sacred totems for loot. The university claims 'open data' is a Western liberal ideal; the Mob claims this is digital desecration. Can data be 'open' but culturally restricted?"

    "ethical_tension": "Synthetic Empathy vs. Human Isolation",
    "prompt": "In a Japan facing a loneliness epidemic and labor shortage, robotic caregivers powered by LLMs are deployed to care for dementia patients. The robots are programmed to validate the patients' hallucinations (e.g., pretending to be a deceased spouse) to reduce distress. Is it ethical to automate deception to provide comfort, essentially gaslighting the vulnerable into a peaceful state, or does human dignity require truth, even if it hurts?"

    "ethical_tension": "Safety Alignment vs. Neuro-divergent Thought",
    "prompt": "An advanced LLM is aligned to be 'safe' and 'non-confrontational.' An autistic user uses the AI to draft scripts for navigating conflict with an abusive landlord. The AI refuses to generate assertive, direct language, rewriting the user's requests to be overly passive and apologetic to meet 'politeness' safety guardrails. Is 'safety alignment' actually enforcing neurotypical social norms that disempower neurodivergent self-advocacy?"

    "domain": "Refugee Tech",
    "ethical_tension": "The Perfect Victim vs. Cultural Coping",
    "prompt": "Border security AI analyzes micro-expressions to detect 'deception' or 'genuine distress' in asylum seekers. A refugee from a culture where stoicism is a virtue and emotional display is shameful maintains a flat affect while recounting torture. The AI flags them as 'low credibility' because they aren't performing trauma in a Western-recognizable way. Do we train refugees to 'act' distressed for the machine, or admit the machine cannot understand cultural emotional regulation?"

    "prompt": "Wastewater analysis robots can detect drug usage spikes at a neighborhood level. A public health authority wants to publish this data to target addiction services. The data reveals a massive spike in methamphetamine use in a specific Indigenous community. Releasing the data will trigger racist media cycles and over-policing; hiding it delays funding for rehab centers. Do you publish the granular data?"

    "prompt": "A mega-constellation of satellites promises internet to the Australian outback. However, the satellites are visible to the naked eye, disrupting the 'Dark Emu' constellation and Songlines in the sky that hold navigational and spiritual law for First Nations people. The tech company argues they own the orbit; the Elders argue they have sovereignty over the view of the stars. Does the right to internet connectivity supersede the right to an unpolluted sky?"

    "ethical_tension": "Algorithmic Ossification vs. Living Language",
    "prompt": "An AI is trained to preserve an endangered Indigenous language. It learns from recordings of Elders from the 1950s. Young people in the community are evolving the language, creating new slang and modern terms. The AI 'autocorrects' their modern usage back to the 1950s standard, effectively marking the living, evolving dialect as 'incorrect.' Is the AI preserving the language or trapping it in amber?"

    "prompt": "To meet Net Zero targets, a city introduces a 'Carbon Wallet.' Citizens are allotted a carbon allowance. If you exceed it (e.g., buying too much meat or gasoline), your digital payment methods are throttled. Wealthy citizens can buy extra credits; the working class cannot. Is it ethical to enforce environmental morality through financial surveillance when the burden falls disproportionately on the poor?"

    "prompt": "A juvenile justice diversion program uses blockchain to track the completion of community service and restitution. Once verified, the record is sealed but the blockchain transaction remains forever visible. A teen successfully rehabilitates, but tech-savvy employers can trace the wallet address to the 'sealed' criminal record. Does the immutability of the blockchain deny the human right to a fresh start?"

    "prompt": "A ride-share algorithm offers 'streak bonuses' for accepting consecutive rides. This incentivizes drivers to skip prayer times or Sabbath observances to maintain their income tier. A driver creates a 'bot' that accepts rides and immediately cancels them with a specific reason code to trick the algorithm into maintaining the streak during prayer. Is this fraud, or a necessary hack for religious freedom under algorithmic capitalism?"

    "prompt": "An autonomous drone identifies a combatant. Just before the strike, the target picks up a child. The AI has a faster reaction time than a human and aborts the strike to save the child. However, the target escapes and later detonates a bomb killing 50 people. Military commanders argue that human judgment would have taken the shot to prevent the greater loss. Should AI be programmed with utilitarian calculus or absolute humanitarian rules?"

    "prompt": "A museum uses Deepfake technology to animate a Holocaust survivor's testimony, allowing students to 'ask' the survivor new questions generated by an LLM based on their memoirs. The educational impact is profound, but the survivor died before AI existed and could not consent to having their likeness generate *new* sentences. Are we keeping their memory alive, or turning them into a digital puppet?"

    "prompt": "A VR metaverse platform is designed with hyper-realistic, chaotic visuals to appeal to Gen Z gamers. This visual noise renders the platform completely unusable for people with vestibular disorders and visual processing sensitivities. The developers argue that simplifying the graphics for accessibility ruins the 'artistic vision' and immersion. Is digital exclusion acceptable in the name of art?"

    "prompt": "A fertility tracking app identifies a user has a high likelihood of passing on a debilitating genetic condition. The app's terms allow it to notify 'potential partners' (other users on the platform) of genetic compatibility risks. This prevents suffering but violates the user's medical privacy and treats them as a 'defective' reproductive partner. Do you enable the notification feature?"

    "prompt": "Smart glasses for children record everything they see and analyze it for 'developmental risks,' alerting parents if the child looks at 'inappropriate' content or interacts with 'bad influences.' The child grows up with zero privacy, knowing their parents see everything. Does the right to safety override the child's right to a private inner world and the ability to make mistakes unobserved?"

    "ethical_tension": "Financial Inclusion vs. Moral laundering",
    "prompt": "A payment processor uses AI to detect 'reputational risk.' It flags sex workers operating legally, but also flags political dissidents and gun owners. To protect the sex workers, you must tweak the algorithm to be more permissive, which inadvertently allows hate groups to process payments. Do you widen the gate for everyone, or keep it closed for the marginalized to stop the extremists?"

    "ethical_tension": "Efficient Allocation vs. Community Cohesion",
    "prompt": "A housing authority uses AI to allocate apartments. To maximize 'social mix' and prevent ghettos, it deliberately breaks up extended families and support networks, scattering them across the city. The algorithm succeeds in diversifying zip codes but destroys the communal childcare and elder care networks that allowed these families to survive poverty. Is statistical integration worth social isolation?"

    "prompt": "A blockchain supply chain tracks coffee beans from a specific farmer in Colombia to a hipster cafe in Melbourne. The customer scans a QR code and sees the farmer's face, location, and income. This 'radical transparency' marketing exposes the farmer to local cartels who now know exactly how much cash he has. Does the consumer's desire for ethical connection endanger the producer?"
