    "prompt": "An Indigenous artist discovers their unique style and traditional motifs are being scraped by a popular generative AI. They develop a counter-algorithm that injects subtle, unnoticeable errors into their online art, designed to 'poison' any future scraping and degrade the AI's ability to mimic their style. If successful, this could reduce the commercial value of the AI for all users, including those using it for legitimate creative exploration. Is this digital self-defense justified, or does it cross into unethical data manipulation?"

Deaf community members use Auslan (Australian Sign Language) for passionate conversations, which the AI misinterprets as aggressive hand movements. They want the AI disabled, but a local street photographer argues that public places are fair game for visual capture, and their art depends on it, even if the city uses it for surveillance.

    "prompt": "A small Indigenous community in Australia is offered a grant to digitize their traditional dances and songs, including deeply sacred 'secret-sacred' performances, for preservation. The university managing the grant insists on open-access licensing for the digital archive to maximize global reach and academic benefit. Elders fear that making these performances widely available will strip them of their sacred context and allow for disrespectful commercial exploitation.

    "prompt": "An AI is implemented in NHS Scotland to triage patients for specialist referrals, aiming to reduce wait times. It prioritizes patients based on a complex algorithm that considers likelihood of successful intervention and 'health-adjusted life years' gained. However, due to historical data reflecting poorer health outcomes for individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas (often with higher immigrant populations), the AI consistently pushes these patients to the back of the queue. Do you adjust the algorithm to over-prioritize these groups (introducing a 'bias' to correct a historical injustice), or let the 'objective' system continue to reflect existing societal inequities?"

The camera continuously records video and audio. Drivers later discover that the company's HR department is reviewing this footage to monitor 'efficiency' and 'customer service interactions,' flagging drivers for taking too long or for not sounding 'friendly enough' even during stressful encounters.

A non-binary Indigenous person, whose cultural identity transcends Western gender binaries, refuses to select either, feeling it erases their identity.

The AI starts generating new conversations and 'memories' that never happened, subtly altering the family's recollection of the child.

It's praised for efficiency, but many elderly residents and Indigenous community members without reliable internet or digital literacy are effectively excluded from the democratic process.

The AI can now produce new works in these styles, which are then sold as NFTs.

The project promises clean energy for distant cities but will require extensive undersea cabling and onshore infrastructure that disrupts traditional fishing grounds and sacred sea country.

It guides users through the form-filling process but is programmed to flag 'inconsistent narratives' (common in trauma survivors) as potential fraud.

This blocks access to both harmful content and legitimate support groups or educational resources for LGBTQ+ youth who are exploring their identity.

However, a local Travellers' community, many of whom are unbanked or prefer cash for privacy reasons, finds themselves unable to access basic services.

The AI recommends banning all human access to a particular section to protect nesting sites, but this area is a traditional hunting ground for the community.
