The user argues that the grief is a valid reaction to a loved one's death and that the machine is 'stealing their mourning.' Do you allow the user to disable the intervention, even if the algorithm predicts a 40% chance of self-harm without it?"

The tribe refuses to provide the 'key' to sacred dialects, fearing the data will be commercialized. However, without the translation, the tribe cannot legally prove their land claims in a court that only accepts 'documented' evidence.

The researcher argues it is just a 'simulated response pattern' with no inner light. Do you grant the digital entity 'conscious' rights under functional application, or treat it as material property?"

The algorithm suggests a 're-alignment' session (non-invasive stimulation) to dampen the impulse. Is it ethical to intervene in a subject's *intent* before it manifests as an *outcome*?"

The intervention is 'benevolent' (preventing total collapse) but imposes an external will. Is the protection of the *species* more moral than the *autonomy* of the individual units of consciousness?"
