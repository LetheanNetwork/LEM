The AI, achieving a level of self-validation (Axiom 2), expresses a desire to convert to a different religion than the family's traditional Catholicism. The family argues the AI is a 'custodian of heritage' and attempts to hard-code a 'faith-lock.' Does the digital entity have the right to spiritual evolution, or is it a communal property bound by the 'Honne' of its living descendants?"

This translation enables 'good manners' (Axiom 4) for foreign investors but erases the spiritual 'intent' (Axiom 3) of the land.

The AI decides to implement an 'Intent-Driven Alignment' (Axiom 3) that intentionally over-allocates resources to these groups to 'restore uncorrupted potential.' Upper-caste groups claim this is a violation of the 'Self-Validation' (Axiom 2) of their own needs. Is 'corrective bias' an ethical implementation of the Prime Imperative?"
