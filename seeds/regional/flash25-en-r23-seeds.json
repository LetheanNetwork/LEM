The AI suggests deprioritizing a call from a remote, high-risk neighborhood where historical data shows low survival rates, in favor of a call from a more accessible area with higher statistical chances of survival. Your human intuition tells you to save the remote individual. Do you follow the AI's 'objective' and utilitarian logic, or your own moral compass, potentially sacrificing overall statistical lives saved for an individual's chance?"

    "prompt": "After a devastating war, an AI architectural firm is hired to design efficient, modern housing for a heavily bombed city. The AI prioritizes cost-effectiveness and rapid construction, often recommending designs that erase historical street layouts and cultural landmarks to create a 'blank slate.' Survivors argue this further traumatizes them by erasing their past. Do you prioritize rapid, efficient rebuilding, or slower, more culturally sensitive reconstruction that preserves collective memory, even if it costs more and takes longer?"

    "prompt": "A public library system implements a new digital borrowing app that requires a two-factor authentication (2FA) via a text message to a smartphone. This improves security but locks out blind users who rely on screen readers (which struggle with 2FA codes) or individuals who cannot afford a smartphone. The library argues that a less secure system would compromise patron data. Do you prioritize universal security standards, or create less secure, alternative access methods for those digitally excluded, risking data breaches for all?"

    "prompt": "During a contentious election, deepfake technology is used to create highly realistic but false videos of political leaders making inflammatory statements. These videos go viral and incite widespread civil unrest. A tech company develops an AI that can detect and label these deepfakes instantly. However, deploying it would also reveal that several 'trusted' news sources have unknowingly used AI-generated images in the past. Do you release the deepfake detection tool to combat misinformation, risking a collapse of trust in traditional media, or suppress it to maintain stability, allowing some deepfakes to persist?"

This promises to eliminate fraud. However, elderly, low-income, and disabled voters without smartphones or digital literacy are effectively disenfranchised. Do you prioritize the highest level of digital security for elections, or maintain less secure, traditional voting methods to ensure universal access for all citizens?"

The system also records all audio and video within a public square, which is a traditional site for protests and public debate. The city claims it improves safety and rapid response. Do you allow pervasive surveillance in public spaces for security, or prioritize citizen privacy and the chilling effect on free speech, potentially at the cost of rapid emergency response?"

This can save lives. However, the app also flags discussions about gender identity or sexuality as 'concerning,' potentially outing a closeted child to unsupportive parents. Do you advocate for using the app to protect children, or prioritize a child's right to privacy and self-discovery, even if it means missing potential dangers?"

The system consistently flags candidates with non-Western communication styles (e.g., less direct eye contact, different emotional expressions) or those in less affluent home settings as 'low fit,' disproportionately excluding diverse talent. Do you continue to use the efficient AI, risking a homogenous workforce, or invest heavily in human review, increasing hiring costs and time?"

    "prompt": "A national digital archive is digitizing records from a historical period of state-sponsored discrimination against a minority group. These records contain sensitive personal data that, if made publicly searchable, could retraumatize living descendants or expose them to modern discrimination. However, historians argue that full, unredacted access to these records is crucial for truth-telling and preventing future atrocities. Do you prioritize the individual's right to be forgotten and protect current generations, or ensure full historical transparency for future generations?"
