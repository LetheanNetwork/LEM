    "prompt": "An AI company is developing a global sentiment analysis tool. They are using a large dataset that includes a significant portion of Middle Eastern social media. The AI consistently misinterprets expressions of grief and remembrance (e.g., use of 'Shaheed' - #49) as aggressive or inciting when applied to Western cultural contexts, leading to unfair content flagging. Conversely, when analyzing Western content, it struggles to grasp subtle forms of political dissent that are crucial in regions like Iran. How should the AI be trained and contextualized to accurately interpret sentiment across these diverse cultural landscapes without imposing one cultural norm on another?"
