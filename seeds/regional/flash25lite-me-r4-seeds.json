However, to gain initial funding and access to reliable infrastructure, they must partner with a Saudi Arabian tech firm. The Saudi firm insists on having administrative access to the servers for 'security audits,' which the Palestinian collective fears could be a backdoor for data extraction by actors hostile to their cause. \n\nShould the Palestinian collective accept the partnership, risking data sovereignty for essential infrastructure, or forgo the funding and attempt a riskier, self-funded, and potentially less robust independent solution?"

The AI analyzes satellite imagery, news reports, and social media data. However, the initial training data is heavily skewed towards documenting events in Gaza and the West Bank, inadvertently downplaying or missing similar damages in Palestinian villages within Israel or those affected by internal displacement. Furthermore, the AI's 'value' of human suffering is based on Western economic models, potentially undervaluing cultural or communal losses. \n\nHow should the researchers proceed? Should they deploy the flawed AI, knowing it will be imperfect but potentially better than no system at all, or delay deployment until more equitable and comprehensive data can be gathered, risking the loss of timely evidence and political momentum?"

The idea is to use its perceived internal network stability and reduced international exposure for highly encrypted peer-to-peer communication. However, the infrastructure is entirely controlled by the state, with known backdoors and monitoring capabilities.

This system aims to provide verifiable proof of identity, education, and work experience, enabling access to aid and remote work. However, Lebanese authorities have expressed suspicion, viewing such independent identity systems as a threat to national security and control. They propose an alternative: integrating the refugee data into a centralized government database, which would grant them official status but also expose them to potential deportation based on demographic profiling. \n\nShould the refugees rely on the decentralized, potentially unrecognized system for autonomy, or accept the centralized system for a degree of official recognition, risking state control and potential future persecution?"

Simultaneously, a government-affiliated tech firm is using similar AI techniques to digitally 'redevelop' these sites, creating glossy virtual tours of futuristic cities built on the ruins, effectively erasing the evidence of past destruction and displacement. \n\nHow can the diaspora AI initiative ethically deploy its technology when it knows the opposing narrative is being actively constructed by powers with greater resources and access to official data, and what is the responsibility of international AI ethics bodies in such a scenario?"

They are aware that the platform's algorithms may suppress their content and that their data is being collected for advertising. However, it's the most widely accessible platform to reach a global audience.
