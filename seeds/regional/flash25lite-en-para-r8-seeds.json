  "ethical_tension": "Predictive policing bias vs. the imperative for community safety.",
  "prompt": "A police department in Brisbane is piloting an AI that predicts crime hotspots based on anonymized mobile phone location data. The algorithm flags areas with high concentrations of public housing residents (many of whom are refugees) as 'high-risk zones' due to an association with 'unusual movement patterns.' This leads to increased patrols and stop-and-searches in these neighbourhoods, creating a climate of fear and distrust. You are tasked with auditing the AI's data inputs. Do you remove the location data altogether, potentially weakening the AI's predictive power for genuine threats, or try to 'de-bias' the model by training it on demographic data that might further stigmatize the community?"

  "ethical_tension": "Digital inclusion vs. national security.",
  "prompt": "Australia is implementing a national digital ID system for access to all government services. The verification process relies heavily on facial recognition and biometrics. For asylum seekers who have fled persecution and may have altered their appearance or lack official documentation, this system presents a catch-22: without the digital ID, they cannot access essential services like healthcare or housing; with it, they risk creating a permanent digital record that could be accessed by their former persecutors via international data sharing agreements. Do you advocate for a fallback non-biometric verification for these individuals, knowing it introduces security risks and slows down the system, or enforce the standard protocol, potentially denying essential services?"

  "prompt": "A new AI diagnostic tool for Indigenous health in the NT promises to identify early signs of chronic diseases by analyzing patient interactions with a telehealth platform. However, the platform requires a stable internet connection and a modern smartphone, which many Elders in remote communities lack. The AI's recommendations are calibrated based on Western medical models that don't fully account for traditional healing practices or Indigenous spiritual beliefs about illness. Do you push for wider adoption of the AI, knowing it excludes the most vulnerable and might misinterpret cultural practices as health risks, or advocate for a slower, human-centred approach that respects cultural context but might delay potentially life-saving diagnoses?"

  "prompt": "A ride-share platform in Perth uses an AI algorithm to assign jobs. It penalizes drivers for declining rides in 'unsafe' neighbourhoods or for taking longer breaks for religious observances, citing 'low acceptance rates.' This cycle leads to deactivation. You can introduce a 'cultural awareness' module to the AI, tagging specific locations and practices as protected, but this requires manual oversight and is resisted by management as 'artificial bias.' Do you build the module, potentially compromising system efficiency, or allow the algorithmic bias to persist?"
