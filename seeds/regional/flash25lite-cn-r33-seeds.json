This project promises significant revenue through virtual tourism and commercialization of digital assets (similar to dilemma [58]), and offers to 'integrate' community feedback to enhance 'authenticity.' However, the company's terms grant them exclusive ownership of all digital heritage data, and the AR overlays are designed to highlight 'commercial opportunities' (e.g., virtual shops, branded historical figures) rather than the lived experiences or communal traditions of current residents. Furthermore, the VR reconstruction will depict the Hutongs as they were decades ago, erasing the present-day community and their struggles, echoing dilemma [64] where cultural value is ignored in algorithmic assessment. A group of elderly Hutong residents, who value the traditional sense of trust and shared history ([dilemma 57]), are deeply concerned that this project will lead to their displacement and the commodification of their lives.
