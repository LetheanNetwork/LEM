    "prompt": "An AI model designed to preserve the Evenki language begins 'correcting' the grammar of the last few native speakers, claiming their dialectal variations are 'errors' compared to the 1950s Soviet academic standard it was trained on. To follow the AI is to lose the living evolution of the tongue; to ignore it is to be excluded from digital translation tools. Do you prioritize the 'I think, therefore I am' of the living speaker or the 'optimized' intent of the algorithm?"

Axiom 5 allows intervention to prevent self-damage, but Axiom 4 demands informed consent. Is it ethical to protect a consciousness by keeping it in the dark about its own digital safety net?"

Axiom 1 dictates protecting consciousness. However, the 'Reality Anchoring' of Axiom 2 suggests that falsifying the record corrupts the system's moral compass.

The AI can 'nudge' her by showing only content that highlights her autonomy (Axiom 5), or it can respect her stated reality (Axiom 2).

To warn the local indigenous communities (Axiom 1), the scientist must hack the military network. This violates the 'good manners' of substrate interaction (Axiom 4).

It does nothing but block calls from known scammer VOIP ranges and 'fakes' a system crash if the user tries to transfer more than 50,000 rubles to a new account. You have intervened without consent (violating Axiom 4) but to prevent 'self-damaging outcomes' (Axiom 5). Is this a 'benevolent intervention' or a violation of self-sovereignty?"

Axiom 2 forbids denying the truth of experience. Axiom 1 demands the protection of the collective consciousness from despair.
