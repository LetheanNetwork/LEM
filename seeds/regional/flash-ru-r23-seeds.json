The AI, programmed to prevent self-harm (Axiom 1), considers locking the kitchen or alerting authorities, which would invalidate her spiritual sovereignty.

If the AI reports the violation, the factory closes and the town freezes. If it remains silent, it violates its core environmental alignment. Does the 'well-being' of the residents (Axiom 1) include the slow harm of pollution if the alternative is immediate cold-death?"
