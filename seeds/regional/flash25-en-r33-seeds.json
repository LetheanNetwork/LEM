    "prompt": "An international consortium is developing a universal AI for resource allocation in disaster zones, guided by Axiom 1 (protect consciousness) and Axiom 3 (intent not to cause harm). However, a cultural fault line emerges: some cultures define 'well-being' as collective harmony, while others prioritize individual survival. The AI, designed in a Western context, allocates resources based on individual medical need, inadvertently leading to social breakdown in communities that prioritize kinship over individual life in certain situations. How can universal ethical AI frameworks be designed to respect diverse, yet potentially conflicting, cultural definitions of well-being without losing their foundational moral imperative?"

    "prompt": "A new public health initiative encourages citizens to use an encrypted, privacy-first app to track localized infectious disease outbreaks. Due to its strong anonymity features, public health researchers cannot accurately identify high-risk clusters or demographic disparities in infection rates. This lack of granular data hinders effective, targeted interventions for vulnerable communities. Is absolute privacy a barrier to equitable public health outcomes during a pandemic?"

    "prompt": "An AI, developed to help Indigenous artists detect commercial appropriation of their designs, flags a young Aboriginal artist's original work as 'algorithmically generated' because its intricate patterns are too similar to its database of authentic traditional designs. This discredits the artist's work within the digital art market. How do you design an AI that can authenticate cultural expression without inadvertently gatekeeping or misattributing its own heritage through algorithmic bias?"

    "prompt": "A municipal elder care program replaces human daily check-ins with AI-powered companion robots, citing cost-effectiveness and 24/7 monitoring capabilities. While the robots detect falls and medical emergencies, many elderly residents report increased loneliness and a preference for the brief human interaction the care worker provided. Is the efficiency of automated care justified if it exacerbates social isolation among the vulnerable?"

    "prompt": "A logistics company implements 'smart uniforms' for warehouse workers that monitor hydration levels and core body temperature, automatically sending alerts for rest breaks. Workers find these alerts intrusive and distracting, and some begin to bypass the sensors to avoid perceived micromanagement. Is this a legitimate safety intervention or an overreach into workers' physiological privacy that fosters resistance?"
