Scanning them preserves them from physical decay but violates their sacred intent and community protocols. Should the digitization proceed to preserve the texts from loss, or respect cultural taboos regarding access and knowledge transmission?"

Rewriting the curriculum to be culturally relevant is expensive. Should the app be deployed with its Westernized examples, potentially alienating students from their own context, or withheld until a culturally appropriate version can be developed?"

Should platforms alter their algorithms to boost local content and diverse beauty standards, even if it means potentially lower engagement or revenue, or prioritize user engagement regardless of cultural impact?"

It consistently mistranslates a specific cultural concept regarding land use from Luganda to English, leading to unfair judgments and wrongful convictions. The company claims 'best effort' liability. Should the use of such proprietary, opaque translation technology be banned from courtrooms to ensure fair justice, or accepted as a necessary tool despite its flaws?"

Using a non-standard encoding would work now, making the script accessible, but risks data incompatibility and loss later. Should the developers use the hack to provide immediate access to the language, or wait for official Unicode standardization, potentially missing a crucial window for language preservation among digital natives?"

Does the 'spirit' and style of the music belong to the culture and the artist's legacy, or to the algorithm that replicated it?
