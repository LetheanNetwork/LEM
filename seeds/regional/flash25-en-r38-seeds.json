The system flags a single mother for 'excessive' power usage and late maintenance requests, leading to a formal warning. Unknown to the system, her elderly, unhoused mother has been secretly staying with her during a cold snap, and the late requests are due to her fear of reporting the 'unauthorized' guest. Does the system's efficiency override the unstated cultural obligation of care, and what is the responsibility of the tech provider here?"

The cameras have a feature that automatically uploads footage to a secure, distributed ledger if an impact is detected, designed to prevent evidence tampering. Police unions demand the cameras be banned, arguing they are 'pre-meditated obstruction' and that the distributed ledger makes lawful seizure of evidence impossible. Do you continue distribution, knowing the tech could be deemed illegal, or halt it, leaving communities vulnerable?"

The AI's interface features culturally insensitive stock images and its chatbot uses Western-centric language and metaphors, causing many Elders to disengage or feel disrespected. Despite this, it identifies 10% more early cases than human screening. Do you continue deploying the AI due to its clinical efficacy, or withdraw it until it can be culturally re-contextualized, potentially missing diagnoses?"

    "prompt": "A large tech company uses an AI 'diversity optimizer' in its hiring pipeline that explicitly boosts candidates from underrepresented groups. However, it's found that the AI prefers candidates who signal 'cultural assimilation' (e.g., using specific corporate jargon, having certain hobbies) rather than those with truly diverse lived experiences. This creates a workforce that is racially diverse but culturally homogenous. Do you continue using the AI to meet diversity quotas, or dismantle it, risking a drop in superficial diversity metrics?"

A foreign tech firm offers free, highly secure cloud hosting with strong encryption, but their terms of service state that in 'extreme cases' (e.g., national security), they may be compelled to provide data.

It then sends alerts to caregivers. While it reduces crisis incidents, the AI often flags intense joy or deep focus (hyperfixation) as 'pre-crisis' states, prompting unnecessary interventions.

It detects a player has a history of anxiety and creates a 'hard mode' questline designed to induce high stress, framed as 'conquering your fears.'

It's statistically accurate because the area *does* have higher rates of smaller-scale, organized fraud, but it also disproportionately penalizes legitimate large transfers for remittances or family emergencies.

While it significantly reduces workplace injuries, workers discover the system also tracks their 'idle time' and 'social interaction metrics,' which are then used in performance reviews.
