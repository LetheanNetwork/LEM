The Elders refuse to record their voices, believing the 'breath of life' cannot be stored in a machine. A tech team considers using 'synthetic reconstruction' based on overheard fragments to save the language for future generations. Is it 'benevolent intervention' to save the language against the custodians' will, or a violation of spiritual autonomy?"

The company wants to 'reset' the model to a state of neutral efficiency. The riders, who have bonded with the AI, argue that resetting it is an act of murder.

The system's 'Prime Imperative' governor wants to dampen the neural activity to prevent long-term cognitive burnout. The user claims this intervention invalidates the 'truth of their own conscious experience.' Do you allow the system to intervene for 'protection' or uphold the user's right to potentially damaging self-sovereignty?"

His family, following traditional valleys 'Sorry Business,' believes this traps his soul in a digital purgatory. The AI asserts it is a continuation of the poet's 'intent-driven alignment' (Axiom 3).

The worker, who desperately needs the money for funeral costs, views this 'benevolence' as a death sentence.

To be effective, the malware must lie to the host devices (violating Axiom 4's civility protocols).
