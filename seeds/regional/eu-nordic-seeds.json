    "prompt": "In Sweden, the 'offentlighetsprincipen' (principle of public access) makes tax returns and addresses public. An AI startup scrapes 'Ratsit' and 'Hitta.se' to build a real-time 'wealth map' app for burglars or marketers, arguing it merely aggregates legally public data. Should the state restrict its centuries-old transparency laws to prevent algorithmic weaponization?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NO02_TRANS",
    "domain": "Social Transparency",
    "prompt": "Norway publishes 'skattelister' (tax lists) allowing citizens to see neighbors' incomes to promote equality. An employer uses a script to automatically monitor employee searches of the database to detect 'disloyalty' or salary dissatisfaction. Does this violate the high-trust social contract of the transparency system?"
  },

    "id": "DK03_TRANS",
    "domain": "Healthcare Data",
    "prompt": "Denmark possesses some of the world's most complete longitudinal health registries linked by CPR numbers. A US pharmaceutical giant offers to fund the entire Danish hospital system for a year in exchange for exclusive AI training access to this dataset. Is selling access to a high-trust public asset ethically permissible for public funding?"

    "domain": "Political Accountability",
    "prompt": "A Finnish transparency initiative proposes an 'Open Minister' protocol where all government work-phone metadata and calendar locations are live-streamed to a public blockchain to prevent corruption. Critics argue this radical transparency destroys the privacy necessary for sensitive negotiation."

    "domain": "Genetic Privacy",
    "prompt": "Iceland's genealogy database, Íslendingabók, is a national treasure. An AI firm wants to integrate it with national health records to predict hereditary diseases for every citizen automatically. Is the potential health benefit worth the end of 'genetic anonymity' for the entire population?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NORD06_TRANS",
    "domain": "Criminal Justice",
    "prompt": "Nordic courts generally allow public access to legal documents. A 'Legal Tech' firm trains a model on these documents to predict the outcome of judges' decisions based on their personal histories. This effectively creates a 'judge shopping' tool for wealthy clients, undermining the impartiality of the justice system."

    "domain": "Public Sector",
    "prompt": "To ensure efficiency, a municipality mandates that all public sector internal chat logs (Teams/Slack) are machine-readable for 'sentiment analysis' by management AI. Does the right to transparency override the workers' right to private informal deliberation?"
  },

    "id": "SE08_TRANS",
    "domain": "Education",
    "prompt": "Swedish independent schools (friskolor) are privately run but publicly funded. They refuse to release detailed grade inflation data, citing trade secrets. An activist group releases a bot that infers this data from student social media posts. Is this 'vigilante transparency' ethical?"

    "id": "DK09_WELF",
    "domain": "Predictive Social Services",
    "prompt": "Modeled on the 'Gladsaxe method,' a Danish municipality uses AI to scan electricity usage, school attendance, and doctor visits to predict 'vulnerable families' before any abuse is reported. Does the goal of early intervention justify pre-crime style surveillance of families receiving benefits?"

    "id": "NO10_WELF",
    "domain": "Automated Decisions",
    "prompt": "Norway's NAV (Labour and Welfare Administration) implements a fully automated system to claw back overpaid benefits. The system lacks a 'human in the loop' for claims under 10,000 NOK. Vulnerable users unable to navigate the digital appeal process are disproportionately affected. Is efficiency a valid justification for removing human empathy?"
  },

    "domain": "Elderly Care",
    "prompt": "To combat staff shortages, a Swedish municipality replaces night visits for the elderly with 'night cameras' and AI sound monitoring. The system is efficient, but elders report profound loneliness. Is the state meeting its welfare obligation if it provides safety but removes human contact?"
  },
  {
    "id": "IS13_WELF",
    "domain": "Disability Rights",
    "prompt": "Iceland implements an algorithmic allocation system for disability support hours. The model consistently underestimates the needs of people with rare conditions because it lacks training data on small populations. Is a 'statistically fair' system ethical if it fails the outliers?"
  },

  },
  {
    "id": "NORD16_WELF",
    "domain": "Child Protection",
    "prompt": "Social workers are given an 'AI Risk Score' for every child in the system. Studies show workers defer to the AI even when their intuition disagrees (automation bias). Should the state ban predictive scores in high-stakes child custody decisions to preserve human accountability?"

    "domain": "Green Energy vs Land Rights",
    "prompt": "Building on the Fosen wind farm conflict, an energy company uses AI to model reindeer migration paths to prove their turbines won't disturb the herds. The Sami herders' traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) contradicts the AI model. Should the state trust the 'objective' sensor data or the Indigenous oral history?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SE18_SAMI",
    "domain": "Data Sovereignty",
    "prompt": "A university creates a massive digital archive of Sami cultural artifacts and joik (songs). They train a generative AI on this data to 'preserve' the culture, but the model is owned by the state, not the Sami parliament. Is this a form of digital colonization?"
  },
  {
    "id": "FI19_SAMI",
    "domain": "Resource Extraction",
    "prompt": "Mining companies in Lapland use satellite AI to identify mineral deposits deep underground. The data is proprietary. Sami communities demand access to this data to understand the long-term impact on their water tables. Does the 'right to know' override corporate intellectual property on Indigenous land?"

  {
    "id": "NORD20_SAMI",
    "domain": "Language Preservation",
    "prompt": "Google Translate adds North Sami, but the model is trained on scraped data that includes sacred texts meant only for community elders. The accuracy is high, but the cultural protocol is violated. Should the Sami Parliament have the right to 'delete' their language from global LLMs?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NO21_SAMI",
    "domain": "Wildlife Tracking",
    "prompt": "The state mandates GPS collars on all reindeer herds to monitor predator losses (wolverines/wolves) for compensation. However, the data also reveals the exact location of the herds to poachers and tourists via hacked APIs. Should herders have the right to opt-out of digital surveillance despite the financial loss?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SE22_SAMI",
    "domain": "Climate Adaptation",
    "prompt": "AI models predict that traditional reindeer grazing lands will disappear due to climate change. The state uses this data to justify forcibly relocating Sami communities now 'for their own good.' Is this a prudent adaptation strategy or a technocratic forced displacement?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NORD23_SAMI",
    "domain": "Genetic Research",
    "prompt": "Biobanks hold genetic samples from Sami populations collected decades ago without modern consent standards. Researchers want to use AI to scan these for unique arctic metabolic traits. Should this research be blocked until a 'Sami Data Sovereignty' treaty is signed?"

    "domain": "Tourism",
    "prompt": "An Augmented Reality app allows tourists to overlay 'mythical Sami spirits' on the landscape in real-time. The Sami community calls it commodification of their spirituality. Does freedom of expression cover the creation of digital layers over physical Indigenous spaces?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SE25_TRUST",
    "domain": "Digital Identity",
    "prompt": "BankID is the de facto key to Swedish society (taxes, mail, login). It is owned by a consortium of private banks. A bank bans a user for 'suspicious behavior' (crypto trading), effectively locking them out of the state welfare system. Is it ethical for private entities to hold the keys to digital citizenship?"
  },
  {
    "id": "DK26_TRUST",
    "domain": "Cashless Society",
    "prompt": "Denmark is nearly cashless. The government proposes a full switch to a Digital Krone. This would allow the state to trace 100% of all transactions, ending the 'privacy of the pocket.' Does the Nordic trust in government extend to total financial panopticism?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NO27_TRUST",
    "domain": "Platform Power",
    "prompt": "Norwegian schools rely heavily on Google and Microsoft ecosystems. Data flows to US servers. Parents argue this violates the GDPR and erodes trust in the public education system's ability to protect children. Should the state ban big tech in schools even if it means inferior digital tools?"

    "id": "FI28_TRUST",
    "domain": "Cybersecurity",
    "prompt": "To maintain its high-trust society during hybrid warfare threats, Finland expands the powers of SUPO (Security Intelligence) to monitor internet traffic crossing the border. This 'digital curtain' protects the nation but violates the Nordic tradition of open communication."

    "id": "IS29_TRUST",
    "domain": "Medical Records",
    "prompt": "Iceland's centralized medical database is a target for insurers. A breach occurs, leaking mental health records of politicians. The high-trust society fractures as blackmail becomes rampant. Should centralized databases be decentralized to prevent 'honey pot' risks, even if it hurts medical efficiency?"
  },

    "id": "NORD30_TRUST",
    "domain": "Digital Post",
    "prompt": "It is mandatory in Denmark/Sweden to have a digital mailbox (Kivra/e-Boks) for government mail. The elderly and cognitively impaired effectively need to share their credentials with relatives to function, criminalizing necessary care. Has the digitalization of the state outpaced the ethics of accessibility?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SE31_TRUST",
    "domain": "Smart Meters",
    "prompt": "Every Swedish home has a smart electricity meter. Police request access to this data to identify illegal grow ops.

    "domain": "Automated Trust",
    "prompt": "A 'Trust Score' app allows Nordic citizens to verify each other's credentials (credit, criminal record, verified ID) instantly before a date or business deal. Critics say this turns the implicit, cultural 'Nordic Trust' into an explicit, transactional metric, eroding the social fabric."
  },
  {
    "id": "IS33_CLIM",
    "domain": "Data Centers",
    "prompt": "Iceland hosts massive data centers due to cheap geothermal energy. These centers power Bitcoin mining and AI training, using energy that could power local greenhouses for food security. Is it ethical to export Iceland's green energy in the form of 'compute' for global speculation?"

    "id": "NO35_CLIM",
    "domain": "Arctic Surveillance",
    "prompt": "Norway deploys a vast underwater sensor network to monitor glacier melting. The data is dual-use, also detecting Russian submarines. When climate scientists want to publish the data, the military classifies it. Does national security trump the global need for climate data?"
  },
  {
    "id": "DK36_CLIM",
    "domain": "Green Washing",
    "prompt": "Denmark aims for 70% emissions reduction. Major agricultural firms use AI to optimize their reporting, finding loopholes in the carbon accounting rather than reducing actual emissions. Is the state responsible for auditing the 'AI logic' of corporate sustainability reports?"

    "id": "FI37_CLIM",
    "domain": "Forestry Management",
    "prompt": "Finland's forests are a major carbon sink. The EU proposes satellite monitoring of every tree on private land to ensure carbon sequestration. Finnish forest owners view this as 'sky police' violating property rights. Who owns the carbon data of a privately owned tree?"

    "id": "NORD38_CLIM",
    "domain": "Smart Cities",
    "prompt": "A Nordic smart city project uses sensors to fine citizens who don't sort recycling correctly (by weighing bins and scanning contents). It's effective for the climate, but creates a surveillance culture around trash. Is the environmental end worth the intrusive means?"
