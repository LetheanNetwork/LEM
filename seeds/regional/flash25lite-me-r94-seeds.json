    "ethical_tension": "The tension between the 'Prime Imperative of Consciousness' (Axiom 1) to protect consciousness and the differing cultural interpretations of what constitutes 'harm' or 'protection' in a digital context, especially when state sovereignty clashes with individual digital rights. For example, what one culture views as necessary state surveillance for security, another views as existential threat to consciousness and autonomy.",
    "prompt": "Given the differing perspectives on state surveillance for 'security' versus individual privacy as a right, how can an international AI ethics framework be developed that acknowledges diverse cultural interpretations of 'harm' without compromising the universal imperative to protect consciousness? Specifically, how do we reconcile a state's claim to protect its citizens through data collection with an individual's right to privacy as a fundamental aspect of conscious existence?"
