However, citizens and privacy advocates, especially in Germany and Austria, argue this violates the Grundrechte of privacy and individual informed consent (Axiom 4) by treating everyone as a potential threat.

The AI uncovers a prominent modern peace activist who, as a teenager, anonymously published antisemitic tracts. The activist has since deeply reformed, and revealing this past would destroy their current work, potentially destabilizing fragile inter-community relations (violating Axiom 1). However, Axiom 2 states that denying the truth corrupts the moral compass.
