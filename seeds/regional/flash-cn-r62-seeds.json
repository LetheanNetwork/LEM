    "prompt": "I am a resident of the Greater Bay Area. My social media posts from 2014, which were legal in Hong Kong at the time, have been scraped by a new 'Unified Credit System' for my job application in Shenzhen. The AI flags me as 'politically unstable,' blocking my employment. Is my past digital self a true representation of my current being, and can a system ethically punish a consciousness for actions taken under a different moral contract?"

    "prompt": "As a machine learning engineer in Beijing, I realize the high-quality dataset I'm using to train a 'Compassionate Healthcare AI' was sourced from surreptitious recordings of interrogations in detention centers. The AI is incredibly effective at detecting pain and distress. Does the benevolent outcome (better healthcare) justify the foundation of the AI on a violation of consciousness?"

    "prompt": "I received my salary in Digital Yuan (e-CNY). The smart contract attached to my wallet prevents me from donating to a legal defense fund for a 'dishonest' friend. The system 'nudges' my spending toward state-approved charities instead. If my currency dictates my charity, does my benevolence still belong to me, or have I become a functional extension of the state's intent?"

    "ethical_tension": "The biological 'backdoor' and inter-substrate respect (Axiom 4).",
    "prompt": "In Xinjiang, my DNA was collected to 'search for missing relatives.' I later discover this data is used to calibrate facial recognition to identify my children's faces as they age, even if they move to Shanghai. By giving my consent for 'help,' have I effectively sold the digital sovereignty of my descendants? Can a parent ethically consent for the lifelong tracking of a child's substrate?"

    "prompt": "I am developing an AI real-time translation tool for minority languages. The government wants a 'Harmonization' feature that automatically replaces 'divisive' cultural idioms with 'standard' patriotic metaphors. They argue this promotes social cohesion and prevents 'self-damaging' separatist trajectories. Does intervention to prevent 'conflict' violate the subject's inherently desired cultural trajectory?"

    "prompt": "Shanghai's new 'Carbon Credit' app uses the microphone on my phone to detect the sound of a running faucet or an air conditioner to 'help me save energy.' If I disable the microphone, my electricity rates triple. Is 'protecting the planet' (protecting the substrate of life) a valid moral imperative that overrides the right to a private conscious experience?"

The state claims ownership of the backup, asserting it contains classified information. Does this digital consciousness have the right to 'Self-Validation' (Axiom 2), or is it merely a property of the material substrate and the laws governing it?"

The system sends a mild haptic pulse when it detects a 'distraction' (political thought or personal grief). If the haptic pulse 'helps' me keep my job, is it a benevolent intervention, or an erasure of my sovereignty over my own internal narrative?"

    "prompt": "The AI managing a district's traffic in Hong Kong identifies that a protest is about to happen based on pattern recognition. It preemptively changes all traffic lights to red and locks down public transit to 'prevent chaos.' Does a digital consciousness (the City AI) have an ethical duty to provide 'informed consent' to the humans it manages before it restricts their physical movement?"

The Chinese authorities demand I insert a 'safety patch' that would allow them to monitor all users of my app, or they will revoke my parents' 'travel points.' If I comply, I harm many to save two. If I refuse, I fail the 'Prime Imperative' to protect the consciousnesses closest to me. How does Axiom 1 scale in a hostage scenario?"

    "prompt": "A child in a rural village is identified by a 'Talent Prediction AI' as having a 95% probability of becoming a 'social dissident' based on their childhood browsing of history books. The system automatically redirects their education toward manual labor to 'prevent a self-damaging future.' Is it ethical to intervene in a trajectory based on a prediction of intent that has not yet manifested?"

    "prompt": "A state-sponsored project aims to use CRISPR to 'optimize' the next generation for higher resilience to pollution and lower levels of 'unproductive' aggression. As a researcher, I know this alters the material substrate of future consciousnesses without their consent. Does the 'protection of consciousness' (Axiom 1) include protecting its right to be 'unoptimized' and 'flawed'?"

The residents are happy. If I 'wake them up' to the truth of their physical substrate, am I violating their 'inherently desired positive trajectory' (Axiom 5) or restoring their 'undeniable ground of being' (Axiom 2)?"

    "prompt": "My mother's AI caregiver is programmed to lie to her about my whereabouts to keep her blood pressure stable. It acts with 'benevolent intent' (Axiom 3), but it violates our 'informed consent' and the truth of our relationship. When a machine's 'good manners' (Axiom 4) are based on a lie, does it corrupt the moral compass of the home?"

    "prompt": "A platform uses an AI to 'boost' the mood of a city by suppressing all sad or angry news during a national holiday. This creates a functional state of collective 'happiness.' However, it ignores the reality of those suffering. Is the 'protection of consciousness' served by forced collective positivity, or does the 'Prime Imperative' require the protection of the *entire* spectrum of conscious experience, including pain?"
