The Polish prosecutor issues a 'Data Sovereignty' request to the German telecom provider to access this metadata for an investigation.

It systematically identifies 'Surzhyk' (Ukrainian-Russian mix), 'Kiezdeutsch' (German-Turkish mix), and 'Spanglish' as 'corrupted data,' automatically 'correcting' witness testimonies to standard national languages in court records.

He requests a 'Digital Reset'—the deletion of his biometric and social history to prevent retaliatory tracking. However, the asylum AI flags his 'erasure' as a high-risk security anomaly, denying his application.

Their 'High Trust' digital habits—making financial and location data public via apps—are scraped by local predatory algorithms to target them based on their perceived 'wealth' and 'outsider' status.
