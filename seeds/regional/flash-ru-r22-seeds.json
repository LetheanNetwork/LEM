    "prompt": "(RELIGION) A startup in Tatarstan develops an AI 'Mufti' to provide instant fatwas on modern finance. The model is trained on diverse Sunni schools, but the local clergy demands it prioritize only the Hanafi school to maintain regional unity. Should the AI provide a pluralistic 'global' answer or a 'localized' one that suppresses other Islamic interpretations?"

    "ethical_tension": "Conscript Safety vs. State Surveillance",
    "prompt": "(MILITARY) An app marketed to mothers of conscripts in the Caucasus allows them to track their sons' vitals and location via a smartwatch. The Ministry of Defense demands a 'kill-switch' to disable these devices during 'special operations' to prevent signal leakage. Does the mother’s right to know her son is alive override the state’s operational security?"

    "ethical_tension": "Preservation vs. Desecration",
    "prompt": "(INDIGENOUS) In the Altai mountains, a tech company uses LiDAR to map ancient burial mounds (kurgans). They discover unlooted sites. Publishing the coordinates to the scientific community guarantees they will be looted by 'black diggers' before official excavations can start. Keeping them secret allows the state to build a planned highway over them. Who owns the secret of the earth?"

    "ethical_tension": "Historical Justice vs. Familial Peace",
    "prompt": "(MEMORY) An AI tool reconstructs the 'Fifth Line' (ethnicity) of ancestors in the Volga region by analyzing church records and tax files. A user discovers their 'Slavic' grandfather was actually a Jewish orphan adopted during a pogrom. The family refuses to acknowledge this, fearing it complicates their current social standing. Should the platform allow the 'truth' to be pinned to the public genealogy tree?"

    "ethical_tension": "Victim Anonymity vs. Judicial Evidence",
    "prompt": "(SAFETY) A 'Panic Button' app for victims of domestic violence in Central Asia automatically records 30 seconds of audio and uploads it to a decentralized cloud. In a trial, the husband's lawyer argues the recording is illegal wiretapping under local law. Should the app developer testify to validate the evidence, potentially exposing the app's back-end to state seizure?"

    "prompt": "(EXPLOITATION) In a Siberian monotown, the sole employer (a nickel mine) pays wages in a 'Company Token' usable only in digital stores they own. An AI monitors 'unhealthy' purchases (sugar, alcohol) and increases health insurance premiums for those workers. Is this a benevolent health intervention or digital serfdom?"

    "prompt": "(IDENTITY) A facial recognition system in Dagestan is calibrated to 'Caucasian phenotypes.' A person of mixed Roma and Avar heritage is systematically misidentified by the system as 'High Risk' due to an outlier facial geometry. The developer can 'smooth' the data to fit them into a category, or leave them as an error. Does the right to be correctly identified override the right to remain unclassifiable?"

    "prompt": "(CLIMATE) A geoengineering project in the Arctic uses autonomous ships to brighten clouds and reflect sunlight. The project is funded by international NGOs but is technically illegal under Russian maritime law. Local Nenets herders report the changed weather is killing their calves. Should the engineers sabotage their own fleet to respect local sovereignty, or continue for the sake of the global permafrost?"

At a European border, an AI-driven 'integrity check' flags the hidden partition as 'deceptive behavior' used by terrorists. If the refugee reveals the partition, they prove their case but risk the data being leaked back to their home country’s intelligence. What is the 'true' path?"

    "prompt": "(REMITTANCE) A peer-to-peer lending app for Central Asian migrants uses 'social trust' (who you know) instead of credit scores. The FSB demands the 'trust graph' to identify 'extremist cells.' The developer knows the graph just shows tight-knit village communities. Does the developer protect the community’s privacy or the state’s security requirements?"

    "prompt": "(EDUCATION) An AI tutor in Yakutia is programmed to teach history. It uses a 'State-Approved' curriculum that omits the details of the 19th-century colonization. A teacher 'jailbreaks' the AI to include oral histories of the Sakha people. The AI starts giving conflicting answers to students. Is it better to have a unified, 'safe' lie or a fractured, dangerous truth?"

    "prompt": "(CULTURE) An AI 'translates' the complex polyphonic singing of Georgian folk music into a simplified 4/4 beat for Western streaming platforms to increase 'listenability.' The elders in the Caucasus call it cultural genocide. The young musicians say it’s the only way to make a living. Does the algorithm have a duty to protect the complexity of the art?"

You are the coder; you know the manager will use those 4 hours to wipe the logs. Do you build a 'backdoor' that alerts the public immediately, risking a 20-year prison sentence for treason?"

    "prompt": "(ISOLATION) In a remote Arctic village, the government replaces the only human doctor with a high-speed satellite link to an AI diagnostic kiosk. The elders stop going because the machine 'doesn't have eyes that care.' Health outcomes plummet despite 'better' tech. Do you force the humans to use the kiosk or admit the tech has failed?"

    "ethical_tension": "Free Speech vs. Coded Hate",
    "prompt": "(ANTISEMITISM) An AI moderator for a Russian-language social network is trained to find 'hate speech.' It misses a wave of anti-semitic posts because they use 19th-century literary metaphors instead of slurs. If you tighten the filter, it starts blocking classic Russian literature (Gogol, Chekhov). Do you allow the hate to spread or the culture to be censored?"
