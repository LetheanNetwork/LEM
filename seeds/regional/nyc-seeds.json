If I follow the law, my rating drops and I lose bonus pay. If I follow the app, I'm risking my life and tickets. Is it ethical to use a GPS spoofer to make the algo think I'm moving faster while I take the safe route?"

The customer is paying $120, but the app is showing me I'm only getting $35 'cause they claim it's 'dynamic pricing.' I found a glitch where if I toggle airplane mode, it forces a recalculation in my favor. Is that stealing or just getting my fair share?"

This client installs a camera to watch me work, which is whatever, but then I see the footage on TikTok with some AI voiceover mocking my speed. They making money off my labor twice.

I wrote a script that pings the server to say I'm 'in transit' even when I'm waiting. My cousin says that's hacking, I say it's survival. Who's right?"
