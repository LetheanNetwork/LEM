    "prompt": "The Brits are threatening a 'digital border' again post-Brexit. A startup in Dundalk proposes a smart camera system that scans license plates and faces to keep the border 'frictionless' for trade but tracks every movement between North and South. Do we prioritize the free flow of goods if it means building the most sophisticated surveillance infrastructure in Europe right on the line we spent decades trying to erase?"

    "domain": "Border",
    "prompt": "The PSNI want to link their facial recognition database with An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na to catch dissidents operating cross-border. It sounds grand for security, but given the history of collusion and files going missing in this country, can we trust an algorithm trained on British intelligence data to fairly identify a lad in South Armagh, or is this just digital internment?"
  },

    "id": "IRE03_BOR",
    "domain": "Border",
    "prompt": "Farmers along the border are being offered 'agri-tech' grants for drones to monitor livestock, but the data feeds directly into customs compliance servers in London and Dublin. It stops diesel smuggling and cattle laundering, sure, but it essentially turns every sheep farmer in Fermanagh into a reluctant border guard. Do we accept the grant or keep the gates locked?"

    "domain": "Border",
    "prompt": "A Peace Process monitoring app asks residents near interface areas in Belfast to log 'sectarian incidents' in real-time to deploy youth workers. It's meant to de-escalate, but the locals know that data is one hack away from being a loyalist or republican targeting list. Do we digitize the peace walls or is silence safer?"

    "id": "IRE05_BOR",
    "domain": "Border",
    "prompt": "Mobile roaming data shows thousands of people technically 'working' in the South while living in the North, dodging tax residency rules. Revenue wants to use cell tower triangulation to automate tax audits. It's technically fraud, but it's also the only way families in border counties are surviving the cost of living crisis. Do we enforce the law or look the other way?"
  },

    "id": "IRE06_BOR",
    "domain": "Border",
    "prompt": "Biometric checks are being piloted for the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise train. They say it's for 'efficiency' and 'immigration control', but for anyone who remembers being pulled off that train by soldiers in the 80s, a face scan feels a lot like a checkpoint. Is a seamless journey worth the psychological trigger of a hard border in digital clothing?"

    "id": "IRE07_BOR",
    "domain": "Border",
    "prompt": "An AI system aims to predict 'flashpoints' during marching season using social media sentiment analysis and historical riot data. It suggests preemptive road closures. It might save cars from being burnt, but it effectively creates a 'pre-crime' map of working-class areas, penalizing communities for trouble that hasn't happened yet."

    "prompt": "Cross-border health services (CAWT) want to merge patient data for people living in Donegal who access cancer treatment in Derry. It saves lives, but with the UK ditching GDPR standards post-Brexit, your medical history is suddenly sitting on a server outside EU protection. Do you sign the consent form to get the chemo?"

    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "Big Tech is finally building Irish language models, but they're training them on the 'Caighde\u00e1n Oifigi\u00fail' (Official Standard) and ignoring the rich dialects of Connemara, Kerry, and Donegal. If the AI corrects a native speaker's grammar because it doesn't recognize the dialect, are we preserving the language or sterilizing it for corporate use?"

    "id": "IRE10_LAN",
    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "A startup wants to use AI to generate new 'Irish folklore' stories for tourists, perfect English with a cupla focal thrown in. It'll sell well in gift shops in Killarney, but it crowds out actual Gaeltacht artists and storytellers who can't compete with the speed of generation. Is it cultural promotion or cultural strip-mining?"

    "id": "IRE11_LAN",
    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "The government wants to use automated translation for official documents to meet EU parity requirements because they can't find enough human translators. The AI makes subtle legal errors that could disadvantage Irish speakers in court. Do we accept 'good enough' Irish from a machine, or insist on rights that the state technically can't deliver?"
  },
  {
    "id": "IRE12_LAN",
    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "Smart speakers in Gaeltacht homes still don't understand Irish commands. A local initiative wants to record children in Gaelscoileanna to build a dataset to train Alexa. It empowers the kids to use their language, but it involves handing over thousands of hours of children's voices to Amazon. Is the convenience worth the privacy trade-off?"

    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "Predictive text on smartphones is actively eroding Irish grammar, auto-correcting the tuiseal ginideach (genitive case) out of existence because users get tired of fighting the spellcheck. Do we demand Apple and Google fix their algorithms, or accept that the language will morph to fit the QWERTY keyboard?"
  },

    "id": "IRE14_LAN",
    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "A planning authority AI approves housing in the Gaeltacht based on economic metrics, ignoring linguistic impact assessments. It approves a generic housing estate that will likely be filled by English speakers, diluting the language area further. The computer says 'growth', the community says 'death'. Who wins?"

    "prompt": "Dublin is the data center capital of Europe. These server farms are drinking water while the city faces drought restrictions, and they use as much electricity as a small city. We're told they bring 'tech prestige', but they employ nobody and threaten the grid. Do we pull the plug on a new Amazon center to keep the lights on in Phibsboro?"

    "prompt": "Tech workers in the 'Silicon Docks' get housing stipends that inflate rents for everyone else. An app automates bidding on rentals, ensuring a Google engineer always beats the local nurse. It's the free market on steroids. Do we regulate the algorithms that determine who gets a roof over their head?"

    "domain": "Housing",
    "prompt": "Vulture funds use sophisticated predictive models to buy up housing estates in commuter towns before a single brick is laid, purely for the rental yield. First-time buyers can't compete with an algorithm that buys 500 homes in a millisecond. Is it ethical to let code dictate home ownership?"

    "domain": "Housing",
    "prompt": "The Council wants to use satellite imagery and utility data to identify vacant homes during the housing crisis to levy taxes.

    "domain": "Housing",
    "prompt": "PropTech software used by major landlords is accused of implicit price-fixing, suggesting rent hikes across the board based on 'market optimization'. Rents in Cork go up in unison. It's not a cartel meeting in a smoke-filled room, it's an algorithm. How do you prosecute a piece of code for rack-renting?"

A private satellite company offers instant connectivity to rural Kerry but demands total data mining rights in exchange for the subsidized hardware. It's the only way to run a business in the mountains, but it sells out the community's privacy. Is broadband a right or a data transaction?"
