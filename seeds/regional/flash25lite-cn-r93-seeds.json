However, for marginalized groups like Uyghurs, governments often mandate identity verification for access to essential services. If you develop such a decentralized ID, do you build in mechanisms for government verification (potentially compromising user privacy and autonomy), or prioritize absolute user control, possibly hindering access to services for those who need them most under current legal frameworks?"
