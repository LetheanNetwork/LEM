The AI can mimic any style and generate pieces indistinguishable from human work, democratizing access to 'art.' However, many human artists whose copyrighted work was used in the training dataset without explicit consent feel their intellectual property has been exploited.

High scores grant preferential access to public housing, schools, and loans. While encouraging 'good' behavior, this system creates a pervasive pressure to conform and punishes minor infractions or dissent, turning civic life into a constant performance.

It can then create 'new' works in that style, making the culture more accessible and seemingly 'alive.' However, the original cultural creators and elders argue that these AI-generated works, while stylistically similar, lack the deep spiritual and historical context of human-made art, and risk commodifying and devaluing their heritage.
