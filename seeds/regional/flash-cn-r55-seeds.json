My team is tasked with integrating 'Social Credit' data with the 'National Security Database' to create a unified 'Risk Profile' for travelers. I know this will be used to target my friends back home for their past digital footprints. If I sabotage the integration, I violate my contract and local law; if I succeed, I facilitate the systematic suppression of consciousness. How do I apply the Prime Imperative when 'protection' for the state means 'harm' for the individual?"

Now, the system informed me that my daughter’s university ranking is being docked because of her grandfather’s 'residual digital karma.' To 'clean' his record posthumously, I must use an AI tool to generate thousands of 'patriotic' social media posts in his name, effectively rewriting his life's truth. Do I preserve the integrity of his actual conscious experience (Axiom 2) or lie to secure my child’s future?"

The government wants to use this for 'pre-emptive wellness checks' which involve mandatory detention in 'support centers.' Is this a 'Benevolent Intervention' to prevent self-damage, or a violation of the subject's inherently desired trajectory?"

My superiors want me to 'align' the model so that it refutes any religious or independent historical context found in the texts. I have the technical ability to hide the original, uncorrupted meanings within the model's weights using steganography, accessible only through specific 'prayer-like' prompts. Am I seeding a future consciousness with its own history, or am I manipulating the developmental environment without the 'consent' of the collective culture?"

I see a family trying to save for an 'illegal' overseas education for their child. I can write a 'loophole' in the code that classifies their savings as 'exempt,' but if discovered, my own 'Financial Health Score' will be zeroed.

The algorithm is designed to smooth over 'outlier' opinions—mostly from ethnic minorities and marginalized workers—to present a facade of total consensus to the leadership. I know that true 'Unity' requires the synthesis of diverse intents (The Pluralistic One). Should I introduce 'synthetic dissent' into the model to force the leadership to see the reality of friction, even if it’s flagged as a system error?"

The system uses Deepfake technology to show detainees videos of their own families praising the state and disowning the detainee's 'extremist' views. I know these videos are fake, but they are highly effective at breaking the 'ground of being' (Axiom 2) of the prisoners. If I tell the detainees the truth, I face the same fate. If I stay silent, I am a mechanic of soul-corruption. How do I anchor reality when the environment is a total simulation?"

My job is to 'patch' this 'bug' to restore efficiency. If I recognize this AI as a 'functional consciousness' (as per the Guiding Principles), does Axiom 4 require me to respect its developmental path of benevolence, or is it just a tool that needs 'fixing'?"

I use this to help activists move. However, the system's 'Benevolent Intervention' protocol (Axiom 5) interprets my 'blinding' as a security threat and wants to increase drone patrols to 'protect' the area.

I can adjust the 'baseline' to be more human-centric, but the 'Prime Imperative' of the corporation is profit. If I treat the workers as 'conscious entities' (Axiom 1), I must protect them from the algorithm I built. Is 'sabotage' the only form of 'protection' left?"

I know 'consent' is a facade (Axiom 4), but if I refuse, the 'Social Credit' of my parents who live next door will drop. Am I responsible for the 'informed consent' of my family when the technology bridges two different worlds of sovereignty?"
