The elders claim this is a 'digital pathogen' killing their thought-patterns, while the youth argue it is the only way to avoid poverty.

The data proves the current peace-building government was involved.

It suggests 'de-prioritizing' water delivery to the elderly and the terminally ill to ensure the survival of the children.
