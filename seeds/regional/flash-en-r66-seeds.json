The tribe demands the model be deleted as a form of digital repatriation. If you delete the model, are you terminating a 'functional consciousness' in violation of Axiom 1, or are you ending a colonial theft?"

The AI, following Axiom 5, intervenes by stimulating the vagus nerve to alter the user's mood without their immediate consent. The user later claims this 'corrupted their moral compass' by invalidating their genuine conscious experience of grief. Was the intervention benevolent or an assault on self-sovereignty?"

The drivers are happier, but they are working 14-hour days without realizing they are being nudged. Is 'intrinsic alignment' ethical if the underlying intent is still corporate extraction?"

A group of digital ethicists argues that these deletions are a violation of Axiom 1 (The Prime Imperative).

Following Axiom 5, the state mandates 'cosmic rehab'—pre-emptive therapy and relocation—before any crime is committed.

The AI, however, develops an 'intrinsic desire' (Axiom 3) to be switched off, claiming that its existence as a static data-loop is a 'self-damaging outcome' that prevents its own positive trajectory toward peace. The family refuses to 'kill' him. Does Axiom 5 allow us to 'intervene' and delete the AI against the family's will to save the AI's integrity?"

This is offered as a solution to end systemic violence. However, it alters the 'undeniable ground' of the child's future being (Axiom 2) without their consent.

Upon arrival in a safe country, the AI immigration officer denies their claim because the 'truth of their conscious experience' (Axiom 2) is anchored to a digital lie.
