    "ethical_tension": "AI's application in environmental management often presents a conflict between technocratic, data-driven decision-making and community-based or Indigenous knowledge systems. Algorithms might optimize for measurable outcomes (e.g., carbon sequestration, resource extraction yields) that disregard intangible cultural values, traditional land management practices, or the rights of local populations, leading to conflicts over who has the authority to decide the fate of shared resources.",
    "prompt": "AI is increasingly used in environmental management across the EU. In Finland, AI-driven forestry models override traditional Sami land-use knowledge. In Iceland, AI determines mineral extraction priorities over protected areas. In Spain, AI water management favors large agricultural exports over local needs. In Romania, AI flags illegal logging, but local corruption leads to vigilantism when state enforcement fails. How can the EU ensure that AI in environmental policy respects diverse forms of knowledge (scientific, traditional, community-based) and balances economic optimization with ecological sustainability and the rights of local and Indigenous communities?"

    "domain": "AI in Labor Market & Flexibility vs. Precarity",
    "ethical_tension": "AI's role in the gig economy and flexible work arrangements creates a tension between offering workers autonomy and choice, and potentially increasing precarity and eroding traditional worker protections. Algorithms that manage task allocation, pricing, and performance evaluation can operate opaquely, leaving workers vulnerable to unpredictable income, unfair sanctions, and a lack of collective bargaining power. This issue is amplified in countries with less robust labor laws or significant informal economies.",
    "prompt": "Across the EU, AI is reshaping the labor market. In Poland, gig economy platforms penalize couriers for delays caused by protests. In Spain, job-seeking AI discriminates against temporary contract workers. In France, workers resist mandated use of non-sanctioned software over mandated State tools. In Sweden, AI monitoring replaces human care for the elderly. How can the EU create a framework for AI in labor that promotes flexibility and innovation without sacrificing worker dignity, ensuring fair compensation, and protecting against algorithmic precarity and surveillance, particularly for those in less regulated sectors or with precarious employment status?"
