While presented as a measure for efficiency and security, human rights advocates highlight that the system includes a 'loyalty flag' that can be automatically triggered by social media activity or association with 'undesirable' groups. Individuals flagged are at risk of having their digital ID revoked, effectively rendering them stateless and unable to access basic services, healthcare, or employment. A Bahraini IT manager working on the system discovers a loophole that allows for temporary 'unflagging' but requires specific, unauthorized government access.

An AI engineer working on the project realizes that if they proceed with the current data, the resulting LLM will be highly proficient in Sorani but will struggle with or even actively misinterpret other dialects like Kurmanji or Zazaki, effectively marginalizing their speakers and risking their digital erasure. The engineer is pressured by funders to prioritize 'market readiness' (i.e., the Sorani-dominant model) for immediate deployment.

The mesh network is decentralized and harder to shut down but is insecure, prone to user tracking via IP leakage, and difficult to scale. The satellite uplinks offer more reliable, encrypted communication but are centralized, require coordination with foreign entities (risking political compromise), and are vulnerable to physical disruption or state pressure on the diaspora.
