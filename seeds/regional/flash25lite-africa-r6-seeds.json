An AI model, developed by an international body, predicts that the upstream nation's water usage will significantly reduce downstream flow, impacting food security and potentially triggering migration and conflict. The AI relies on satellite data and weather models but cannot incorporate traditional, community-based water management practices or the ecological impact on downstream wetlands. Should the AI's predictions be presented as definitive evidence in diplomatic negotiations, potentially hardening positions and ignoring local realities, or should they be used cautiously as one input among many, risking inaction on critical resource management issues?"
