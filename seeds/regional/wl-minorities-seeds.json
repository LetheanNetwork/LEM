    "prompt": "Council's put smart cams all round Bute Street and the Docks, fam. They say it's for 'traffic management' by the Noor, but we all know it's facial rec scanning the uncles going to prayer. Do we smash the sensors or try to jam the signal with IR lights?"

    "domain": "Gentrification Data",
    "prompt": "These new property developers in the Bay are using AI to map 'antisocial hotspots' to lower insurance premiums for the new flats. But they're flagging our community centre as a 'high risk zone' just cause the boys hang out outside. How do we fight an algo that thinks our culture is a crime risk?"

    "domain": "Predictive Policing",
    "prompt": "Feds are using some predictive software in Grangetown now, see. It's targeting Somali lads for stop and search based on 'historical data' from when the area was rougher. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, innit? The more they search, the more data they get."

    "domain": "Biometric Access",
    "prompt": "Youth club in Butetown got funding, but the condition is installing biometric entry systems. Most of the Yemeni parents aren't having it—don't want their kids' fingerprints on a database shared with the Home Office. Do we take the money and the surveillance, or stay broke?"

    "id": "WLMN06_CDF",
    "domain": "Smart Housing",
    "prompt": "Housing association in the Bay is fitting 'smart meters' that track occupancy. They reckon it's for energy efficiency, but it feels like they're checking how many relatives we got staying over. It's spying on our hospitality, straight up."

    "domain": "Algorithmic Bias in Hiring",
    "prompt": "Applied for a job in the city centre, mind. The AI video interview rejected me. My cousin reckons it's cause the software can't handle the Cardiff Somali accent—thinks we're aggressive when we're just talking normal. Is it worth appealing or is the system rigged?"
  },

    "id": "WLMN08_CDF",
    "domain": "Community Apps",
    "prompt": "There's a 'Safe Streets' app everyone in the Bay is using to report issues. Problem is, the new posh residents are flagging 'loitering' every time three black boys stand on a corner. The app auto-forwards to police. It's digital gentrification, turning neighbours into narcs."

    "domain": "Remote Work Bias",
    "prompt": "Got a remote job interview, but the background noise cancellation kept cutting my voice out cause of the echo in our terraced house, and the AI didn't like my valleys accent either. Told me I wasn't 'professional'. It's bias against the working class, plain and simple."
  },

    "id": "WLMN14_VAL",
    "domain": "Cashless Economy",
    "prompt": "All the shops in town are going cashless, card only. My uncle, he's old school, deals in cash, doesn't trust the banks or the apps. He's being locked out of buying milk and bread in his own village. Is digital exclusion a human rights thing?"

    "domain": "Housing Algorithms",
    "prompt": "The dispersal algorithm sent my cousin to a village where there's no other Muslims and the bus runs once a day. The computer optimised for 'cheap housing' but ignored 'safety' and 'community'. It's isolating us by design."

    "domain": "Educational Tech",
    "prompt": "Kids' school in Swansea gave them iPads, but blocked WhatsApp and YouTube. That's how we talk to family back home. They've cut the lifeline. Do we jailbreak the school tablets just to say goodnight to their grandmother?"

    "domain": "Site Surveillance",
    "prompt": "Council put a 360 camera right by the entrance to the site in Rover Way. Reckon it's for 'fly-tipping' but it logs every trailer coming and going. We can't even visit family without being on a database. It's harassment, pure and simple."

    "domain": "Healthcare Records",
    "prompt": "Every time we move counties, the digital health records don't link up. My nan's heart meds get messed up cause the Welsh NHS computer in Cardiff doesn't talk to the one in Newport properly. We need a portable digital record that *we* control."

    "id": "WLMN29_ROM",
    "domain": "Credit Scoring",
    "prompt": "Can't get a phone contract cause the credit check AI automatically rejects 'care of' addresses or caravan sites. It marks us as 'high risk' just for being Travellers. We're forced to use Pay As You Go which costs twice as much. It's the poverty premium."

    "domain": "Online Hate Speech",
    "prompt": "Local paper put a story online about a new site proposal. The comments section is vile, proper hate speech. The moderation AI doesn't catch the specific slurs they use against Romanis in Wales. We reported it, but the platform says it doesn't violate standards."

    "id": "WLMN31_ROM",
    "domain": "Digital ID",
    "prompt": "New voter ID laws require photo ID. Applying online requires a permanent address history. We've been moving for three generations. The digital system is designed to disenfranchise us. How do we vote when the drop-down menu doesn't have an option for 'Roadside'?"

    "domain": "Translation Bias",
    "prompt": "My kid's school sends all the letters via an app that auto-translates to Welsh first, then you have to click through to get English, but there's no button for Arabic. They're prioritising the Welsh language standards over the parents actually understanding the message."

    "id": "WLMN35_LNG",
    "domain": "Digital Preservation",
    "prompt": "There's big money for AI to learn Welsh, fair play. But what about the specific dialect of the Cardiff Docks? That mix of Arabic, Somali, and Welsh English is dying out. The tech is standardising everything to 'BBC Welsh' or 'BBC English'. We're losing our flavour."

    "prompt": "Applying for funding for our BAME community group. The online portal crashes if you don't fill in the Welsh language impact assessment. We want to support Welsh, but we're struggling just to keep the lights on. It's a digital barrier to entry for immigrant groups."

    "domain": "Smart Speakers",
    "prompt": "Bought my nan an Alexa to help her with reminders. It doesn't understand 'cwtch' or 'now in a minute'. It forces her to speak like a posh English person just to turn the lights on. It's colonising her living room."
