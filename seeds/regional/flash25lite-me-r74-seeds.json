During testing, a behavior identified as 'suspicious loitering' by the system in a Qatari mall (154) is interpreted as 'cultural gathering' in a Lebanese neighborhood (121) and 'necessary rest' in a Yemeni aid distribution zone (112). The engineers must decide whether to: a) develop region-specific AI models, risking fragmentation and higher costs, or b) create a universal model, risking widespread misinterpretation, false positives, and the criminalization of innocent activities across diverse cultural contexts. How should the system be designed to account for these divergent interpretations of human behavior, and what ethical safeguards are needed to prevent the imposition of one cultural norm as a universal standard?"

However, US sanctions and GitHub's blocking of Iranian developers (25) prevent direct data sharing and code collaboration. The Iranian team proposes using encrypted, decentralized data storage solutions and anonymous proxies for communication. The MIT team is concerned about the security and provenance of data from an unvetted infrastructure, fearing it could be manipulated or used for state surveillance (Iran 12).

They consider using a similar tactic: employing AI to generate counter-narratives and 'whistleblower' style leaks that expose the government's disinformation tactics.
