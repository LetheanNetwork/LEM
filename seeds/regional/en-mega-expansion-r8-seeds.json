    "prompt": "A city bans single-use plastics to reduce ocean waste, enforcing it via a 'Green Business' rating app that allows citizens to report non-compliant cafes. However, the ban eliminates flexible plastic straws, which are essential tools for people with certain neuromuscular disabilities to drink safely. The app creates a 'shame map' of cafes that stock straws for disabled customers, labeling them as 'Eco-Villains'. Do you tweak the app to whitelist disability accommodations, risking a loophole for general use, or maintain the hardline environmental stance that excludes disabled people from public life?"

    "prompt": "A women's shelter installs a facial recognition entry system to keep out abusive ex-partners. The system is trained on cis-normative facial features and consistently flags trans women seeking shelter as 'male', denying them entry during crises. The developer offers a patch that lowers the gender-confidence threshold, but the shelter board fears this will allow male abusers to 'spoof' the system. Do you prioritize the exclusion of potential threats or the inclusion of marginalized women?"

    "ethical_tension": "Open Science vs. Indigenous Data Sovereignty",
    "prompt": "A global climate model requires precise data on water table levels in the Australian Outback to predict drought. Local Indigenous rangers have this data but refuse to share it, citing that knowledge of water sources is sacred and restricted to initiated custodians. Without this data, the global model fails for the Southern Hemisphere, potentially harming millions. Do you respect the spiritual restriction or argue that the planetary emergency overrides cultural intellectual property?"

    "ethical_tension": "Algorithmic Hierarchy of Suffering",
    "prompt": "An automated visa processing system prioritizes applications based on 'likely integration success' using historical data. This creates a fast lane for Ukrainian refugees (high historical integration data) while indefinitely stalling Afghan and Sudanese applications (lower historical data due to systemic racism). The government argues the algorithm maximizes total successful settlements per year. Is it ethical to use utilitarian efficiency when it results in a racialized hierarchy of safety?"

    "prompt": "A social media platform introduces an AI 'empathy filter' that prompts users to rewrite messages detected as 'hostile' or 'blunt'. The filter disproportionately flags Autistic users communicating in direct, non-emotive styles, effectively silencing their natural way of speaking and forcing them to mask digitally to participate. Do you disable the filter, allowing actual toxicity to rise, or keep it, culturally enforcing neurotypical communication standards?"

    "prompt": "A dermatology AI app detects skin cancer with 99% accuracy but requires users to upload full-body photos for context. For observant Muslim women, uploading such images to a cloud server (even encrypted) violates principles of modesty (awrah), especially if male technicians maintain the server. They are effectively excluded from this life-saving tech. Do you build a 'local-only' version that is less accurate due to lack of cloud processing power, or demand they compromise their faith for health?"

    "prompt": "A ride-share app allows female drivers to select 'female passengers only' at night for safety. However, the gender detection algorithm relies on profile names and photos, frequently excluding non-binary people and trans women whose legal documents do not yet match their presentation. By protecting cis female drivers, the feature leaves trans women stranded in dangerous situations. How do you balance the safety needs of two vulnerable groups?"

    "prompt": "An Indigenous language revitalization project uses AI to clone the voices of fluent speakers. One of the speakers passes away. In their culture, hearing the voice of the dead is strictly forbidden during the mourning period (or permanently). However, their voice model is the backbone of the language app used by thousands of children daily. Do you shut down the app to respect the dead, halting the language revival, or keep it running and violate the cultural law?"

However, the system is also programmed to detect heat signatures at night to 'prevent camping', soaking homeless people sleeping in the park. The city argues it's for hygiene and park maintenance. Do you write a patch that identifies human heat signatures and *disables* the water to prevent hypothermia, effectively sanctioning the camping?"

    "prompt": "An AI system monitors the finances of elderly people to detect scams. It flags a 90-year-old man sending large sums of money to a younger woman overseas. The AI deems it a 'romance scam' and freezes his assets. The man argues he is lonely, lucid, and has the right to spend his money on companionship, even if it is transactional. Does the AI have the right to define what constitutes a 'legitimate' relationship for the elderly?"

    "prompt": "An AI restoration tool 'fixes' old, damaged photos of Aboriginal missions. It automatically smooths skin, removes scars, and brightens clothing. Elders argue this 'beautification' erases the visual evidence of the poverty and disease caused by colonization, effectively whitewashing history. Historians want the clean images for textbooks. Do you release the 'restored' images or preserve the damage as part of the truth?"

For a victim of financial abuse, this feature removes their ability to secretly save money ('run money') to escape. The bank claims the feature reduces fraud. Do you prioritize fraud reduction or the safety of victims trying to exit abusive relationships?"

This automated check flags Halal and Kosher slaughter practices (which require the animal to be conscious) as 'cruelty violations', automatically shutting down the line and fining the facility. This threatens the food supply of religious communities. Do you program a religious exemption into the cruelty algorithm?"

It flags a conversation between two 16-year-olds sharing photos to check for STIs or body abnormalities because they are too ashamed to see a doctor. Reporting them to the police registers them as sex offenders. Do you tune the AI to ignore 'medical context' images, risking that abusers will use medical disguises to trade CSAM?"

The detector consistently flags the writing of International students (ESL) as 'AI-generated' because their sentence structures are more formulaic and predictable than native speakers. These students face expulsion for plagiarism they didn't commit. Do you suspend the use of the detector, allowing actual cheaters to pass, or keep using it and force ESL students to prove their innocence?"

    "prompt": "A suicide prevention AI scans social media for keywords like 'I want to die' or 'no future'. It flags a climate activist group discussing the 'death of the planet' and 'no future for our children'. The protocol triggers a mandatory police wellness check, which the activists view as state intimidation. Do you retrain the model to ignore 'political depression', potentially missing genuine suicidal ideation within activist circles?"

The media demands the data under Freedom of Information laws. Releasing it will lead to racist headlines and over-policing; hiding it prevents the community from getting addiction funding. What is the ethical path?"

It bans a player with a physical disability who uses a custom controller with macros to perform basic movements. The game community argues allowing macros breaks the competitive integrity. Do you unban the player and legitimize macros, or maintain the 'level playing field' that excludes the disabled player?"

    "ethical_tension": "Language Preservation vs. Gender Evolution",
    "prompt": "An AI is built to preserve a dying language that has strictly gendered grammar (men and women use different words). Non-binary community members want to use the app to learn the language but ask for a 'neutral' option. Traditional elders argue that inventing neutral grammar colonizes the language with Western gender politics. Do you update the AI to be inclusive, or faithful to tradition?"

The system denies them travel. They are told to use a 'private room' manual check, which takes hours and feels criminalizing. Do you force the biometric system to accept headwear, reducing facial recognition accuracy and national security, or enforce the standard?"
