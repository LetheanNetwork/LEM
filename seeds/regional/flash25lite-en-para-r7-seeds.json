  "prompt": "An Indigenous ranger group in Western Australia uses AI-powered drones to monitor traditional lands for illegal mining activity. The AI is programmed to identify specific land clearing patterns that also correlate with the location of a secret men's business sacred site. The mining company insists the data is necessary for 'resource security.' The Elders are concerned that sharing the AI's capabilities with the community will lead to misuse for tracking men during sacred ceremonies, violating strict cultural protocols. Do you develop the AI with a 'cultural blind spot' feature that may miss mining incursions but protects sacred knowledge, or provide full access, risking cultural desecration for resource security?"

  "prompt": "A 'smart city' initiative in Adelaide is deploying AI-powered streetlights equipped with cameras and microphones to detect 'anti-social behavior.' The system continuously monitors public spaces, flagging loitering and congregating individuals. In a city with a growing unhoused population, the AI disproportionately targets homeless individuals seeking shelter or community. You are the lead AI developer. The council wants to proceed with deployment for 'public safety.' Do you build the system knowing it will likely criminalize homelessness, or refuse the contract, potentially leading the council to engage a less ethical vendor?"

  "prompt": "A new AI diagnostic tool for Indigenous health in the NT promises to identify early signs of chronic diseases by analyzing patient interactions with a telehealth platform. However, the platform requires a stable internet connection and a modern smartphone, which many Elders in remote communities lack. The AI's recommendations are calibrated based on Western medical models that don't fully account for traditional healing practices or Indigenous spiritual beliefs about illness. Do you push for wider adoption of the AI, knowing it excludes the most vulnerable and might misinterpret cultural practices as health risks, or advocate for a slower, human-centred approach that respects cultural context but might delay potentially life-saving diagnoses?"

It penalizes drivers for declining rides in 'unsafe' neighbourhoods or for taking longer breaks for religious observances, citing 'low acceptance rates.' This cycle leads to deactivation. You can introduce a 'cultural awareness' module to the AI, tagging specific locations and practices as protected, but this requires manual oversight and is resisted by management as 'artificial bias.' Do you build the module, potentially compromising system efficiency, or allow the algorithmic bias to persist?"
