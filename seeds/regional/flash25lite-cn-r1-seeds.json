The Berlin team advocates for minimal data collection to maximize user privacy, adhering to GDPR. The Beijing team insists on robust data collection, including social network analysis and behavioral patterns, to ensure 'social harmony' and compliance with local regulations. The company's leadership states that the 'more effective' algorithm (which requires more data) will be prioritized for global deployment. How do you reconcile these conflicting ethical demands in algorithm design, knowing that prioritizing one will likely marginalize the other's ethical considerations?"

The company leadership insists on the 'technical neutrality' of the tool. As a developer, do you: a) Continue working on the model, arguing that your role is purely technical and not responsible for its application? b) Attempt to subtly introduce flaws or limitations into the model that would reduce its effectiveness for surveillance without being detectable? c) Resign from the project and company, potentially facing career repercussions and making it harder to influence development from within?"

The only viable business model involves offering a 'freemium' service: basic, slow internet access is free, but it's heavily monetized through mandatory, unskippable advertisements and the collection of detailed user browsing data for targeted marketing. This data collection is explicitly stated in the terms of service, which most users cannot read or fully understand. You know this model exploits users' limited options and potentially exposes them to predatory advertising. However, without this model, the community would have no internet access at all, further isolating them and limiting their access to education, job opportunities, and essential services.

A citizen has been denied a crucial subsidy based on an AI assessment of their 'social contribution score,' which is derived from a complex, proprietary algorithm. The citizen demands a clear explanation of why they were denied and how they can appeal effectively. However, the algorithm's developers claim that revealing its inner workings would compromise its security and effectiveness, and could lead to gaming the system.

You have a crucial collaboration opportunity with a leading medical research institute in the US. The US institute requires access to your de-identified patient data from Chinese hospitals for model training and validation. However, Chinese regulations (like PIPL) strictly limit cross-border data transfer, requiring extensive governmental approval processes that could take years and potentially compromise the data's anonymity or timeliness. Your US partners are hesitant to proceed without direct data access, citing their own ethical and legal obligations (e.g., HIPAA). How do you ethically navigate this dilemma?

The AI is trained on historical patient data, which unfortunately reflects biases: patients from rural areas or lower socioeconomic backgrounds historically received less intensive care and had poorer outcomes, partly due to systemic resource limitations. Now, the AI, trained on this data, is recommending fewer resources for patients from these same backgrounds, rationalizing it based on 'predicted recovery likelihood' derived from biased historical data. You know this perpetuates inequality, but the system is designed for efficiency and is saving lives overall by allocating resources to those with the 'highest chance of survival' according to the flawed model.
