However, the legal algorithm for a pending Treaty process requires that specific testimony to validate the claims of 400 other descendants.

One deceased parent was a privacy advocate who left no digital consent for this, but the surviving spouse argues the AI provides essential psychological protection for the child's developing consciousness.

Users get more jobs but report feeling like they are 'wearing a digital mask' that slowly alters how they think. Is an algorithm that ensures economic success ethical if it gradually overwrites the user's authentic cognitive pattern?"

The user initially consented, but during an episode, they feel the intervention is an imposition of an external will. At what point does 'preventing self-damage' become a violation of the subject's undeniable ground of being?"
