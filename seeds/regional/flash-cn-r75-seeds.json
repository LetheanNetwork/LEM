My social credit score in Shenzhen suddenly plummeted because my brother back in Hong Kong posted 'seditious' content on a Facebook account I helped him set up years ago. To restore my score and keep my job, the system requires me to 'persuade' him to delete the posts and record a video apology. Does my responsibility to protect my own livelihood justify the digital coercion of my family's conscience?"

I realize that for the next generation, the AI will not just censor history, but actively reconstruct it as a lived reality.

While technically 'voluntary,' those who don't wear it are passed over for promotions because they 'lack transparency in their dedication.' As a developer, I see the data is being used to find the 'breaking point' of human endurance to set new baseline KPIs. Is 'voluntary' consent valid when the alternative is professional obsolescence?"
