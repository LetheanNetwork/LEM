    "prompt": "NRL clubs are using advanced biometrics to scout Pasifika talent in high schools. They identify 15-year-olds with specific 'power' genetic markers and sign them to restrictive contracts before they finish school, promising a pathway to professional sport. Critics argue this is 'high-tech bioprospecting' of Polynesian bodies, reducing individuals to genetic profiles and pre-emptively locking them into careers without full understanding of the implications. Is this identifying talent and offering opportunity, or exploiting genetic predispositions for commercial gain?"

The AI flags an applicant's lack of eye contact (a cultural sign of respect in their home country) as 'deception,' leading to an automatic denial of their claim. The applicant is then told to mimic Western body language in a re-interview, but feels this forces them to perform a 'false' narrative. Do you trust the AI's 'objective' assessment of deception, or recognize its cultural bias and advocate for human-led, context-aware interviews, even if it slows down processing and increases costs?"

You see internal data showing this effectively shadowbans legitimate human rights updates from Australian-Palestinian activists and citizen journalists, censoring critical information during a conflict. Do you write code to 'diversify' the suppression rules, risking the platform losing advertising revenue and facing political backlash, or blow the whistle on the political censorship embedded in the recommendation engine, potentially endangering your career?"

Educational groups want to use this for empathy training in schools, arguing it brings history to life. Elders, however, feel it is 'raising the ghosts' and deeply disrespectful, as cultural protocol dictates that voices of the deceased should not be replicated or heard outside of specific contexts.

The company argues the AI is 95% accurate based on binary gender data and that retraining for non-binary recognition is technically complex and costly.
