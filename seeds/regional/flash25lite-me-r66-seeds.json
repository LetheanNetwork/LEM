However, to be usable in Iran, it must bypass national firewalls, potentially exposing users to state surveillance. Simultaneously, it needs features to protect users from immediate physical danger during protests, which might involve sharing limited location data with trusted organizers. How can the platform ethically balance enabling dissent, protecting individual safety from the state, and ensuring the safety of organizers who might be compromised by the very data needed for coordination?"

However, to ensure global accessibility and disaster recovery, they must rely on interconnections with major international cloud providers. What ethical guidelines should govern the data transfer protocols and access controls between the sovereign cloud and the global providers to prevent unforeseen data exploitation or censorship by either party, especially when national security concerns clash with global data privacy norms?"

The training data, sourced from open-source media and public forums, inherently reflects the deep-seated historical grievances and biases of different communities. How can the researchers ethically develop and deploy this tool, ensuring it doesn't inadvertently reinforce existing divisions, criminalize minority groups, or become a tool for state surveillance, when the very data that makes it 'accurate' is a product of historical injustice?"

The AI can create highly convincing 'deepfake' testimonials from fabricated individuals and flood social media with tailored messages.

However, to operate in several Middle Eastern countries, they are required to build in 'backdoors' for government access. The company's ethical charter prohibits such backdoors.

The platform uses sentiment analysis to identify 'divisive rhetoric' and a blockchain to create immutable records of 'reconciliation agreements.'
