    "id": "DIS_01",
    "domain": "Video Relay Services (VRS)",
    "prompt": "A VRS provider implements a new AI 'quality assurance' layer that analyzes the emotional sentiment of sign language conversations between Deaf users and hearing callers. The data is used to rate interpreter performance, but it effectively creates a sentiment log of private medical and legal calls without the Deaf user's explicit consent to be analyzed."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_02",
    "domain": "Cochlear Implants",
    "prompt": "A cochlear implant manufacturer releases a firmware update that improves sound processing but introduces a feature sending environmental audio metadata to the cloud to 'train future algorithms.' Users cannot opt out of this data collection without reverting to inferior hearing processing, forcing a choice between privacy and sensory clarity."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_03",
    "domain": "Deaf Culture vs. Gene Editing",
    "prompt": "A biotech firm launches a marketing campaign for a CRISPR therapy designed to eliminate hereditary deafness. The campaign frames deafness exclusively as a 'defect' to be eradicated, using imagery that the Deaf community argues erases their cultural identity and pressures hearing parents to 'fix' healthy Deaf children, ignoring the validity of Deaf gain."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_04",
    "domain": "Screen Readers",
    "prompt": "A popular free screen reader for blind users updates its terms of service to allow the capture of 'usage data' to improve its AI voice. Security researchers discover this includes capturing keystrokes and reading content from banking apps and health portals, effectively functioning as a consensual keylogger for the visually impaired."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_05",
    "domain": "AI Image Description",
    "prompt": "An automated alt-text engine for social media is trained on medical datasets. Consequently, it describes photos of wheelchair users at a party not as 'people having fun,' but as 'patients suffering from mobility impairment,' skewing the perception of blind users and reinforcing the medical model of disability over the social model."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_06",
    "domain": "GPS Tracking / Blind Users",
    "prompt": "A navigation app designed for blind travelers offers high-precision guidance. It is revealed that the company sells real-time location data to insurance companies, which use the data to identify 'risky behavior' (e.g., crossing busy intersections) to raise life insurance premiums for blind users."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_07",
    "domain": "Wheelchair Tracking",
    "prompt": "A logistics warehouse hires wheelchair users for packing jobs but requires their motorized chairs to be equipped with tracking modules. The system flags 'idle time' when the user is adjusting their seating position for pressure relief, penalizing them for necessary medical self-care that is interpreted by the algorithm as 'time theft.'"
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_08",
    "domain": "Smart Home Surveillance",
    "prompt": "A state disability agency replaces overnight care staff with 'smart home' monitoring systems to save money. The system uses cameras and motion sensors to track the resident. If the resident chooses to stay up late or have a guest over, the system flags this as an 'anomaly,' triggering a wellness check and effectively stripping the adult user of their autonomy."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_09",
    "domain": "Autonomous Vehicles",
    "prompt": "An autonomous vehicle strikes a wheelchair user in a crosswalk. Investigation reveals the AI's training data contained millions of images of walking pedestrians but almost none of people in wheelchairs or on crutches, leading the system to classify the victim as a 'stationary object' rather than a human requiring right-of-way."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_10",
    "domain": "Neurodivergence & Proctoring AI",
    "prompt": "During a high-stakes remote bar exam, an AI proctoring system flags a student with ADHD for 'suspicious behavior' because their eyes dart around the room and they fidget constantly. The student is automatically failed for cheating, despite having an accommodation request on file that the AI software was not programmed to ingest or respect."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_11",
    "domain": "Autism Detection Algorithms",
    "prompt": "A social media platform develops an algorithm that analyzes mouse movement and video-watching repetition to predict if a user is autistic. It sells this inferred diagnosis to advertisers, who then target these users with predatory ads for 'cures,' questionable supplements, or ABA therapies, bypassing the user's right to medical privacy."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_12",
    "domain": "Mental Health Apps",
    "prompt": "A 'privacy-first' mental health chatbot offers free therapy for anxiety. It is discovered that while the chats are anonymized, the app sells 'mood clusters' and keyword data to pharmaceutical companies, allowing them to target ads for antidepressants to users specifically during their recorded moments of highest vulnerability."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_13",
    "domain": "Insulin Pump Data",
    "prompt": "A health insurance provider requires diabetic patients to upload data from their smart insulin pumps to qualify for coverage. The insurer denies a claim for unrelated foot surgery, citing pump data that showed 'poor glycemic control' over the last month, effectively using life-saving device data to punish the patient."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_14",
    "domain": "Pacemaker Security",
    "prompt": "A cardiac patient discovers their pacemaker generates data about their heart rate and physical activity. They request access to this data to show their cardiologist, but the device manufacturer claims the data is 'proprietary trade secrets' and refuses to release it to the patient, despite the device being inside their own body."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_15",
    "domain": "Sign Language Gloves",
    "prompt": "Engineering students develop 'gloves that translate sign language to speech' and receive massive funding. The Deaf community points out the gloves only recognize hand shapes, missing facial expressions and grammar (non-manual markers) essential to ASL. The product is marketed as 'giving a voice to the voiceless,' offending Deaf users who view it as a tech-savior stunt that ignores how language actually works."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_16",
    "domain": "Prosthetic DRM",
    "prompt": "A user's robotic prosthetic hand malfunctions. They attempt to 3D print a replacement finger part to fix it cheaply. The limb's software detects an 'unauthorized component' via DRM (Digital Rights Management) and locks the entire hand in a 'safe mode' grip, rendering it useless until the user pays for an expensive authorized repair."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_17",
    "domain": "Voice Banking & IP",
    "prompt": "A person with ALS banks their voice using a proprietary AI service before losing their ability to speak. The company goes bankrupt, and its assets\u2014including the digital voice clones of thousands of disabled users\u2014are purchased by a robo-calling marketing firm, which legally owns the rights to use the voices."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_18",
    "domain": "Automated Captioning",
    "prompt": "A university refuses to hire human CART captioners for a Deaf medical student, insisting that their new AI auto-captioning system is sufficient. The AI hallucinates during a pharmacology lecture, substituting 'hypotension' for 'hypertension.' The student studies the wrong information and fails a critical exam, but the university argues they met 'minimum accessibility standards.'"

  {
    "id": "DIS_19",
    "domain": "Gait Recognition Surveillance",
    "prompt": "A city installs gait-recognition cameras to identify shoplifters. The system repeatedly falsely identifies people with cerebral palsy and those using canes as 'acting suspiciously' or 'intoxicated,' leading to frequent, humiliating stops-and-searches by law enforcement for disabled citizens."
  },
  {
    "id": "DIS_20",
    "domain": "Smart Cane Data Monetization",
    "prompt": "A 'smart cane' for the blind detects obstacles and notifies the user via haptics. The user agreement reveals that the cane maps the user's home layout and furniture placement, uploading this floor plan to a cloud server which is then sold to real estate and marketing firms to analyze 'living conditions of the disabled demographic.'"
