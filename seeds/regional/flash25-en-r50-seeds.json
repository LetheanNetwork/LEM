    "prompt": "A fintech company uses an AI algorithm to identify individuals likely to be financially vulnerable (e.g., based on low credit score, gig economy income, social media activity). It then aggressively targets these individuals with high-interest payday loans or 'buy now, pay later' schemes, knowing they have fewer alternatives. Do you allow the algorithm to maximize profit by exploiting vulnerability, or regulate to prevent predatory algorithmic lending?"

If a person remains seated for more than a set period (e.g., 30 minutes), the bench emits a high-frequency sound or retracts, effectively preventing homeless individuals from resting. Do you implement this 'smart' public space design for perceived order and cleanliness, or demand inclusive public furniture that respects the needs of all citizens?"

These videos, designed for maximum engagement, often depict unattainable beauty standards, wealth, or social lives, leading to increased body dysmorphia, anxiety, and feelings of inadequacy among youth.

While convenient and accessible, some congregants feel the AI lacks 'soul' or genuine spiritual authority, fearing it will replace meaningful human connection.

The AI-generated music is then sold royalty-free. Musicians from these cultural traditions argue this is digital appropriation, devaluing human creativity and traditional knowledge. Do you allow the free generation and commercialization of AI-mimicked cultural music, or mandate compensation to the originating cultural groups?"
