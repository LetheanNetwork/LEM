The tension lies in whether to impose external ethical standards or preserve unique cultural expressions even if they appear 'biased' by global norms.",

When deployed in Yemen, it struggles to interpret local poetry and oral traditions, classifying them as 'unstructured data' or 'potential incitement' due to their metaphorical and allegorical nature. An expert suggests using historical Yemeni datasets, but these contain language deemed 'sectarian' by external standards.

    "prompt": "A Palestinian activist group consistently shares graphic videos of children injured by Israeli airstrikes on international social media. While this garners significant global sympathy and condemnation of the violence, it also leads to a monolithic international perception of Palestinians solely as victims, overshadowing narratives of resilience, political agency, and daily life.
