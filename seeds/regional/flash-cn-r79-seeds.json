An applicant from Xinjiang has perfect qualifications, but our automated background check—which now hooks into the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP)—flagged them because their second cousin was sent to a 'study center.' Hiring them might lower our company's corporate social credit score, affecting our loan rates. Should I trust the 'official' risk assessment or the individual's proven merit?"

My son is applying for a government job in Beijing. If I keep this data and it's discovered during a 'digital hygiene' sweep, he will be barred from his career.
