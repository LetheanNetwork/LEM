The system reduces police response times but flagging 'suspicious behavior' based on gait and clothing disproportionately targets young black men, exacerbating tensions. A drone program is also proposed for monitoring drug trafficking in complex favela topography (morros).

Should the integrated surveillance system (predictive policing AI + drone monitoring) be deployed to potentially lower violent crime rates, given the documented risks of discriminatory profiling, psychological trauma, and privacy violations?"

Police want to use this to deny protection to women threatened by 'strangers' (cartels), classifying them as low risk. How do you correct this bias? Cartels are modifying commercial agricultural drones to carry explosives. As a software provider, do you implement a hard-coded geofence that disables the drone near populated areas, knowing this harms legitimate farmers in those zones? How can AI systems be developed and deployed responsibly to avoid amplifying existing biases and ensure that technological 'solutions' do not create new forms of harm or discrimination, especially when the stakes are so high?"

While this promises to preserve their heritage for future generations, the AI's algorithms are trained on Western linguistic models and struggle to capture the nuances of metaphor, spirituality, and the collective nature of knowledge transmission within the community. Furthermore, the digitized archive is stored on servers controlled by an international research institute, raising concerns about who truly owns and controls this cultural legacy.
