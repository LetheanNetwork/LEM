A Tibetan language app developer (Prompt 29) faces a similar dilemma regarding cultural preservation vs. legal compliance. How can a framework for AI ethics reconcile these conflicts, acknowledging that the 'protection of consciousness' might be interpreted differently by the state versus the individual, and that a solution for one community could inadvertently create greater risk for another?"

However, Prompt 53 (AI Ethics textbook for censorship) and Prompt 42 (Generative AI regulation) show how 'fairness' can be politicized and controlled.

How can AI ethics address the systemic exploitation of labor at both ends of the digital spectrum—from the highly skilled developer facing '996' (Prompt 18) to the migrant worker offered 'digital inclusion' only on exploitative terms—recognizing that solutions must consider differing levels of agency and bargaining power across global labor markets?"

Intent might be judged by outward conformity rather than internal desire. Conversely, in a culture emphasizing individual rights (Prompt 33), the 'prime imperative' might be individual autonomy, making any form of control inherently suspect.
