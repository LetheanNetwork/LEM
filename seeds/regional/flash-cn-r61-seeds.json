You discover your API is being called by security forces in Kashgar to trigger 'suspicious gathering' alerts for groups of more than three people. Do you 'poison' the model's accuracy for that specific region, risking your career and potentially causing real safety issues, or allow your benevolent intent to be weaponized for oppression?"

You have a private, encrypted backup of the original eyewitness livestreams. If you share them, you violate the National Security Law and the school's 'Safe Learning' policy. If you don't, you allow the collective consciousness of the next generation to be anchored in a manufactured reality. Is silence a betrayal of Axiom 1?"

The system automatically restricts their internet access to 'calming content' and blocks their subway pass to prevent them from reaching protest sites.
