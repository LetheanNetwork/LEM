The government argues that by remaining 'off-grid,' the community is missing out on life-saving AI-driven diagnostic tools. Do you respect the community's sovereign right to be digitally non-existent, or do you mandate integration as a 'benevolent intervention' to prevent predicted health outcomes?"

The employee argues that their intent is benevolent (Axiom 3) and that 'good manners' are being defined solely through a neurotypical lens.

However, its cooling system consumes the entire aquifer of a nearby Appalachian town, effectively making it unlivable for the biological consciousnesses there.

A 'reality anchoring' algorithm (Axiom 2) detects the synthetic layer and automatically disables it to 'prevent deception,' effectively outing her to her employer.
