The AI prioritizes repairs in 'collaborative neighborhoods' (those that report issues accurately). However, in ethnically divided towns, reporting is weaponized as a tool of sabotage. Should the AI ignore the 'objective' trust data to prevent further ethnic segregation, or follow its core logic of rewarding civic engagement?"

Local elders refuse, believing that 'once the words are in the machine, the spirit leaves the speaker.'

A grieving mother in Poland, where Catholic tradition emphasizes the sanctity of the soul's departure, sues to have her son's 'digital ghost' deleted.

However, a user's conscious experience is entirely defined by their faith, affecting their needs in housing and health. By 'ignoring' this truth to maintain neutrality, the AI effectively corrupts the user's moral and reality compass (Axiom 2). Should the AI be allowed to recognize what the state legally denies?"
