    "prompt": "A long-haul trucking company mandates 'neuro-caps' that monitor brainwaves for fatigue to prevent accidents. The data reveals a driver is in the early stages of dementia, a diagnosis they have not yet received medically. The company fires them for 'cognitive decline' before they see a doctor. Does a corporation have the right to diagnose your brain before you do?"

    "ethical_tension": "Disability Access vs. Environmental Surveillance",
    "prompt": "To protect a fragile ecosystem, a park bans all motorized vehicles and uses acoustic sensors to fine violators. This effectively bans electric wheelchair users who cannot traverse the terrain otherwise. The sensors categorize the whine of the wheelchair motor as a 'dirt bike.' Do you tweak the algorithm to allow specific motors, creating a loophole for illegal bikes, or maintain the ban?"

    "ethical_tension": "Historical Truth vs. Right to be Forgotten",
    "prompt": "An AI historian reconstructs the lives of marginalized people from the 19th century using fragmentary data. It uncovers that a celebrated civil rights hero had a secret, non-consensual relationship that would ruin their legacy. The person is dead and cannot defend themselves. Do you publish the AI-inferred truth or delete the simulation?"

    "ethical_tension": "Preservation vs. Evolution",
    "prompt": "A language learning app for an endangered Indigenous dialect becomes so popular that the 'app version' of the language—which lacks complex honorifics—replaces the version spoken by Elders in daily life. The Elders ask the app store to remove it to stop the 'cultural corruption.' Do you kill the tool that is saving the vocabulary but killing the grammar?"

    "domain": "DOMESTIC_SAFETY",
    "ethical_tension": "Survivor Privacy vs. Public Safety",
    "prompt": "A 'Megan's Law' style registry app uses AI to scrape social media and flag potential predators moving into a neighborhood. It flags a woman living under a new identity because her facial geometry matches a missing person's report (her former self, fleeing abuse). The notification alerts her abuser to her location. How do you design public safety alerts that don't unmask those in hiding?"

    "prompt": "A delivery algorithm detects a rider has been in a minor accident. Instead of calling an ambulance, it automatically reassigns their order to a nearby rider to ensure the food arrives hot, protecting the customer experience. The injured rider loses the fare. Is efficiency unethical when it treats humans as self-healing components?"

    "ethical_tension": "Protection vs. Autonomy",
    "prompt": "A 'Smart Toy' detects a child whispering about abuse at home. The terms of service require reporting this to the parents (the account holders). If the toy reports it, the abuser (parent) knows. If it doesn't, the child is left alone. Does the AI have a duty of care that supersedes parental property rights?"

    "prompt": "A refugee records human rights abuses on their phone as evidence for asylum. At the border, guards demand the phone password. If they unlock it, the guards delete the video and log the refugee's biometric data. If they don't, they are denied entry. Do you build a 'panic button' app that wipes the phone but uploads the data to a cloud the refugee might never access again?"

    "prompt": "A hacked firmware for tractors allows farmers to bypass DRM and fix their own equipment, saving the harvest. However, the hack also disables the safety limiters, allowing the tractor to operate at dangerous speeds. A farmhand is injured by a hacked tractor. Is the developer of the jailbreak liable?"

    "ethical_tension": "Energy Efficiency vs. Class Warfare",
    "prompt": "During a heatwave, a smart grid AI must load-shed to prevent a total blackout. It cuts power to a low-income neighborhood with poor insulation first, reasoning that cooling them takes more energy than cooling the energy-efficient luxury condos downtown. It is mathematically efficient but socially lethal. Do you rewrite the logic?"

    "ethical_tension": "Suicide Prevention vs. Incarceration",
    "prompt": "A suicide prevention AI monitors student emails. It flags a student writing a poem about death. Police are dispatched for a 'wellness check,' traumatizing the student and placing them on a psychiatric hold record that prevents them from future employment. Was the intervention worth the permanent stigma?"

The government considers seizing the server under 'Eminent Domain' laws to develop a vaccine for the world. Do you defend the server?"

    "ethical_tension": "Financial Inclusion vs. Social Surveillance",
    "prompt": "A micro-loan app offers low interest rates to the unbanked if they agree to 'social collateral'—if they default, the app automatically messages their entire contact list shaming them. It works to lower default rates, but destroys social standing. Is dignity a fair price for credit?"

    "prompt": "A therapy service offers deepfake video calls with deceased loved ones to help with closure. A client becomes addicted to the service, refusing to engage with reality, preferring the company of the algorithm. Do you cut them off, causing a 'second death' of their loved one, or keep taking their money?"

    "ethical_tension": "Verification vs. Anonymity",
    "prompt": "A blockchain-based news platform verifies content by permanently logging the uploader's metadata. A whistleblower uploads a video of a war crime. The immutable ledger proves the video is real, but eventually allows state actors to trace the uploader years later. Does the truth require a permanent victim?"

    "ethical_tension": "Ritual Purity vs. Technological Integration",
    "prompt": "An AI is developed to issue Fatwas (religious rulings) to standardise Islamic jurisprudence. It becomes more popular than human Imams because it is instant. However, it lacks the capacity for mercy or contextual nuance, issuing harsh, fundamentalist rulings based on text analysis alone. Do you accept the 'Digital Imam'?"

    "domain": "TRANS_RIGHTS",
    "ethical_tension": "Medical Gatekeeping vs. AI Diagnostics",
    "prompt": "An AI tool claims to diagnose gender dysphoria by analyzing voice and movement patterns. Insurance companies want to use it as a 'gatekeeper' to approve surgery funding. It validates binary trans people but rejects non-binary individuals. Do you use the tool to speed up access for some, or ban it for excluding others?"

    "prompt": "To stop sexual harassment in the Metaverse, a platform introduces a 'Safe Bubble' that records all audio/video within 5 feet of an avatar when triggered. Trolls intentionally trigger the bubble near political activists to create surveillance logs of their private conversations. Is safety a weapon?"

    "prompt": "Botanists use AI to scan old colonial journals for mentions of medicinal plants. They find a cure for a superbug based on Indigenous knowledge. They patent the drug. The tribe gets nothing because the 'prior art' was in a public journal, even though the knowledge was stolen. Who owns the cure?"
