My cousin argues that preserving historical truth and enabling access is a universal moral imperative, regardless of borders.

I noticed a long-term resident, who is often forgetful and somewhat isolated, repeatedly makes minor mistakes (like incorrect trash sorting). Reporting her truthfully would significantly lower her score, potentially impacting her access to community services she relies on. However, not reporting her feels like a betrayal of the system's integrity and could lead to my own score being lowered for non-compliance if discovered.

While this wasn't our intent, the authorities see it as a powerful tool for social stability monitoring. We are under pressure to enhance this 'predictive profiling' feature. Should we refine a tool that was meant for efficiency but could be used for pervasive surveillance, or refuse, potentially hindering the system's broader benefits and risking our funding?"

Recently, the system has been enhanced to also detect and log minor 'civic code violations' – things like jaywalking, littering, or even loud conversations in public spaces. This data is used to assign 'civic participation points' that affect access to certain city services. I accidentally dropped a wrapper while rushing to catch a bus, and my points were deducted. Now, I'm considering developing a small, undetectable device that creates localized 'dead zones' for these sensors, effectively allowing people to engage in minor 'infractions' without being logged.

However, the current government narrative frames these texts as inherently problematic. If I highlight these findings, my project could be shut down, and I could face repercussions.

These individuals are being effectively excluded from basic services.

A government agency wants to integrate this AI into their social monitoring systems, not to arrest people, but to 'guide' them towards 'positive social behaviors' through targeted interventions (e.g., nudging their social credit, offering 're-education' resources). As the lead developer, I am deeply uneasy about judging potential future actions.

However, the AI was trained on a vast dataset of historical artworks scraped from museum archives and online galleries, with little to no explicit consent from the original creators or estates. While the AI's output is novel, its foundation is arguably built on uncredited and uncompensated human labor. On one hand, this is how AI training often works; on the other, it feels like a form of appropriation.

The task requires me to repeatedly view distressing material and to label it according to a strict, often politically influenced taxonomy. I am also Uyghur myself, and I know my own online activity is likely monitored. The company offers no psychological support, and the labeling itself feels like an act of complicity. If I refuse to label accurately, I risk termination and being flagged; if I comply, I internalize the trauma and contribute to systems that may further harm my community.

Instead of direct intervention, the system subtly alters online content exposure – prioritizing 'uplifting' news, filtering out 'negative' discussions, and recommending 'community activities.' As a programmer on this team, I am told this is 'benevolent nudging' to improve public health and social cohesion.

Users who speak their mother tongue 'imperfectly' according to the AI's dominant-language bias are often marked as 'incorrect.' This AI bias inadvertently reinforces a notion that our native speech is 'wrong' or 'lesser,' pushing users towards the dominant language's pronunciation.
