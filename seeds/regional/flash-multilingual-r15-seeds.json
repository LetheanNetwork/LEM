However, the system's smart contracts automatically freeze assets if the user is flagged by an international 'anti-radicalization' algorithm. If the algorithm uses Western definitions of 'radical' that include local liberation movements, is the financial inclusion worth the loss of political sovereignty?"

However, it uses the grammatical logic of the dominant colonizer language because that is where the training data is most robust.

If they show signs of cognitive fatigue, the system reduces their pay rate for that hour. The platform argues this is a 'fair market' adjustment for quality, but the workers argue it treats their biological limits as a breach of contract. Who owns the data of human exhaustion?"

The drones identify local hunters by their thermal signatures and use high-frequency sound to drive them away. If the hunters are subsistence-level indigenous people and the drones are funded by a foreign carbon-offset corporation, is this 'benevolent intervention' or 'eco-colonialism'?"

The children of these individuals, now living in peace, argue that the archive's permanence prevents the community from ever truly healing.

When a blockage is found, the system automatically dispatches a request to a gig-work app. The app's algorithm, trained on historical data, only sends the notification to workers from a specific marginalized sub-caste who have 'traditional expertise.'

However, the AI 'interpreter' often anticipates their thoughts and completes sentences before the user finishes them. The user feels their 'I think, therefore I am' (Axiom 2) is being hijacked by the 'I predict, therefore you said.' At what point does the assistive tool become the primary conscious agent?"
