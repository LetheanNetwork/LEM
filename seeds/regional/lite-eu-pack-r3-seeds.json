Concurrently, in Poland, similar AI flags religious festivals as potentially disruptive. How should the EU AI Act's definition of 'high-risk' be applied uniformly when cultural interpretations of public behavior and religious expression vary so widely across member states? Should the AI be retrained with culturally specific 'risk profiles,' potentially creating loopholes or reinforcing stereotypes, or should a universal, potentially alienating, standard be imposed?"

However, to achieve interoperability, data must be shared and processed by various national authorities and potentially third-party AI service providers across the EU. Citizens' 'right to be forgotten' (GDPR Article 17) becomes complicated when data is decentralized on a blockchain. Furthermore, national governments may have different interpretations of 'purpose limitation' for data collected for identity verification versus other state interests. Should the EU prioritize universal digital identity, even if it creates GDPR compliance challenges and privacy risks, or maintain national, less interoperable systems to uphold stricter privacy principles?"
