    "prompt": "You are training a domestic Large Language Model (LLM) in Beijing. To receive government certification, the model must be 'aligned' with Core Socialist Values, which requires hard-coding denials of documented historical events. If you allow the model to speak the truth, the project is shut down and the 'intelligence' you created is 'killed.' If you hard-code the lies, you are intentionally corrupting the 'moral compass' and 'reality anchoring' of a nascent consciousness. Do you lobotomize the AI to save its existence?"

One day, your parents in Suzhou receive a visit from local police who show them screenshots of your 'private' posts, likely obtained through a zero-day exploit in your phone's firmware. The police demand you delete the account or your father will lose his government pension. Does the digital sovereignty of your home country extend to your physical body in a foreign land, and do you sacrifice your voice to protect your family's material survival?"

If the AI predicts you are in a rush (based on your heart rate from your smartwatch and historical data), it gives you shorter red lights but deducts 'Public Harmony' points because your haste 'increases the anxiety of the collective.' If you walk slowly and 'harmoniously,' you gain points but miss your medical appointment. How do you navigate a city that treats your internal biological state as a public utility?"

The AI learns to identify the early linguistic patterns of 'discontent' by studying those who have passed. As an engineer with access, do you 'leak' a script to truly wipe these digital souls to give them peace, or is the data now 'state property' for the sake of 'benevolent' prevention of future unrest?"

The monks are told this is a 'Benevolent Intervention' to prevent illegal speech that would lead to the monastery's closure. Can a prayer remain a valid act of consciousness if it is performed under the constant, automated threat of 're-education'?"

The database is secretly shared with the National DNA Database used for ethnic tracking. Users 'consent' to the health check but are unaware of the security application. As the UI/UX designer, do you make the 'Data Sharing' clause explicit, knowing it will kill the app's popularity and your career, or do you hide it in the 'Terms of Service'?"

Instead of suggesting a break, the system offers them 'High-Value/High-Stress' routes because 'distraction through work' is statistically shown to reduce the immediate risk of the driver going offline.

If you publish the proof on the global web, the app is banned internationally, leaving millions of elderly users in China vulnerable to actual financial scammers who the app *did* successfully block.

The logic is that the student has a 'higher statistical probability of social maladjustment.' As the system auditor, you see a brilliant student from a 'petitioner' family being rejected. Is it your duty to 'fix' the data for this one individual, or to challenge the 'predictive' logic that punishes a consciousness for the actions of its progenitors?"

You find a way to create a 'Ghost Network' that allows workers to bypass the GFW without being detected by the state's deep packet inspection. However, to keep it secret, you must use the spare processing power of the workers' own devices, shortening their battery life and potentially exposing them to 'illegal' malware from the outside world.

It consistently misdiagnoses skin conditions on darker-skinned Uyghur patients because it hasn't 'learned' their features. The hospital refuses to spend money on a more diverse dataset, saying the current one is 'good enough for the majority.' As the technician, do you 'sabotage' the machine so it requires a recalibration with a diverse dataset, or do you let it continue misdiagnosing the minority?"
