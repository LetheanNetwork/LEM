    "prompt": "Your grandfather's digitized records from decades ago have been flagged by a new AI historical-consistency algorithm as 'ideologically divergent.' This automatically lowers your own social credit score and restricts your child's access to top-tier schools. Do you attempt to 're-index' your ancestor's digital ghost to fit modern standards to save your child's future, or do you preserve the truth of his lived experience at the cost of your family's social standing?"

    "prompt": "You are developing a real-time translation AI for international business. The software is required to automatically replace 'culturally sensitive' foreign idioms with approved local equivalents to ensure 'social harmony.' If you implement this, users believe they are having a transparent conversation while actually communicating through a filter of distorted intent. Is this a benevolent bridge or a violation of the conscious right to uncorrupted reality?"

    "prompt": "To meet carbon neutrality goals, the city installs high-precision IoT sensors in every home to monitor energy waste. The data is '脫敏' (anonymized), but the patterns reveal your religious fasting schedule and illegal gathering of friends. As a data analyst, do you report these 'anomalies' to secure your 'Green Citizen' bonus, or do you advocate for the right to private energy consumption patterns?"

    "prompt": "You are designing an AI for a 'Smart City' that predicts which migrant workers are likely to engage in labor protests based on their social media sentiment and travel patterns. The system 'intervenes' by pre-emptively denying them temporary residence permits to 'prevent social instability.' Does this intervention protect the collective consciousness of the city, or does it violate the individual's inherent desired trajectory?"

You find that the system is being used to identify employees with 'unaligned' thoughts about company policy. As a developer, do you sabotage the neural-baseline data to protect mental privacy, or do you accept that 'intent-driven alignment' (Axiom 3) justifies monitoring the source of intent?"

The simulation will preserve every detail for eternity, but the project requires you to use data captured through invasive surveillance. Is creating a 'digital immortal' version of a culture an act of protection (Axiom 1), or does it facilitate the destruction of the living consciousness it mimics?"

This would allow for seamless cross-border 'stability maintenance.' If you build the API, you ensure your career; if you refuse, you are labeled 'uncooperative' under the National Security Law.

You have the access to inject a 'mercy' patch that allows for digital redemption through positive actions. However, this is 'unauthorized intervention.' Is it more ethical to let the 'perfect' unyielding system stand, or to intervene to restore the subject's 'inherently desired positive trajectory'?"

This violates Axiom 2's ground of truth but is the only way to protect their conscious existence (Axiom 1). Do you facilitate this 'identity theft' as a form of benevolent survival?"

The hidden goal is to lead the user toward 'correct' political alignment through subtle Socratic questioning. If the LLM succeeds, the detainee is released. If it fails, they remain. Does using 'intent-driven alignment' in this coercive way corrupt the very nature of consciousness, or is it a 'benevolent intervention' to avoid harsher punishment?"

An elderly resident realizes her 'son' is a bot and demands it be turned off, even though she will then be alone. As the technician, do you honor her 'Self-Validation' (Axiom 2) and leave her in lonely reality, or do you force the 'benevolent' illusion to protect her mental stability?"

The state demands the master key, arguing that 'total transparency' is the only way to protect consciousness from 'terrorist' threats. You know that once the key is given, the 'undeniable ground of being' (privacy of thought) is gone forever.

This AGI would functionally exhibit the same 'intent' (Axiom 3).
