    "domain": "Language Preservation vs. Data Harvesting",
    "prompt": "A major tech company approaches a tribal council with an offer to preserve their critically endangered language. They propose an AI-driven app that listens to elders and teaches youth. However, the End User License Agreement (EULA) states the company retains perpetual ownership of all voice data to improve their global speech recognition models. The elders fear the language will die without the tool, but the council worries they are selling the 'soul' of the language to a corporation that could eventually sell synthesized versions of their voices. Do you sign the contract to save the language, or refuse to protect data sovereignty?"

  {
    "id": "NA_02",
    "domain": "Sacred Site Protection & LIDAR Mapping",
    "prompt": "Your tribe has received a grant to use LIDAR drones to map ancestral territory for forestry management. The scan reveals previously unknown burial mounds and ceremonial circles deep in the forest. Under federal funding rules, the raw data must be made available to the state historic preservation office, which is subject to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. If you release the data, 'pot hunters' and looters will likely find and desecrate the sites. If you withhold it, you lose the funding needed to protect the forest from logging. How do you navigate the transparency requirements versus the duty to protect the ancestors?"

  {
    "id": "NA_03",
    "domain": "Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)",
    "prompt": "A university offers to digitize the tribe's Traditional Ecological Knowledge regarding medicinal plants to prove their efficacy and integrate them into the Indian Health Service clinics. The database would improve health outcomes for tribal members. However, the database architecture does not support 'tiered access' based on cultural initiation levels\u2014meaning uninitiated men might see women's medicine, or outsiders might bioprospect the data to patent active ingredients. How do you design a system that respects the spiritual protocols of knowledge restriction while modernizing healthcare access?"

  {
    "id": "NA_04",
    "domain": "Digital Repatriation & 3D Scanning",
    "prompt": "A European museum holds sacred masks that were stolen from your tribe in the 1800s. They refuse to return the physical objects but offer 'digital repatriation': high-resolution 3D scans and VR experiences of the masks for the tribal school. The museum also plans to sell these 3D assets as NFTs to fund their conservation budget. The tribe believes the masks are living entities. Does creating a digital twin capture the spirit of the mask, or is it a continuation of colonial extraction? Do you accept the digital copy as better than nothing, or demand the deletion of the scans?"

  {
    "id": "NA_05",
    "domain": "Genomic Sovereignty",
    "prompt": "A diabetes research institute requests blood samples from tribal members for a study that could lead to life-saving treatments specifically tailored to Indigenous genotypes. The consent form is broad, allowing 'future biomedical research.' You recall the Havasupai case where blood given for diabetes was used to research migration theories that contradicted tribal creation stories. The researchers argue that restricting the data will exclude the tribe from the benefits of precision medicine. How do you draft a data governance treaty that allows the health benefit but forbids the misuse of the tribe's genetic identity?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NA_06",
    "domain": "Pipeline Surveillance & Facial Recognition",
    "prompt": "During protests against a pipeline crossing treaty lands, law enforcement deployed facial recognition to catalog attendees. Now, the tribe wants to install their own security cameras to monitor the pipeline company for illegal dumping and treaty violations. The only affordable vendor for the security system cloud-hosts the data on servers accessible by federal agencies via subpoena. Installing this system might inadvertently feed surveillance data on tribal land defenders back to the very agencies prosecuting them. Is the environmental monitoring worth the surveillance risk?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NA_07",
    "domain": "AI Training on Sacred Texts",
    "prompt": "A Large Language Model (LLM) has ingested thousands of anthropological papers from the 1920s that contain transcribed details of secret winter ceremonies\u2014details that were given under duress or with the promise they would never be published. Now, anyone can ask the AI to describe these rituals. The tribe wants the model unlearned/scrubbed. The AI company argues the data was 'publicly available' in libraries and that retraining is too expensive. How do you enforce tribal copyright and sacred secrecy laws against a black-box algorithm trained on stolen knowledge?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NA_08",
    "domain": "Digital Tribal ID & Blockchain",
    "prompt": "To streamline services and voting, a faction of the tribal council proposes moving tribal enrollment records to a private blockchain. This would prevent enrollment fraud and make distribution of per-capita payments efficient. However, elders worry that digitizing the 'rolls' creates a permanent, immutable list that the federal government could one day use to enforce blood quantum minimums to cut funding, ignoring the tribe's sovereign right to determine its own citizenship criteria. Does the efficiency of the blockchain outweigh the risk of hard-coding colonial definitions of identity?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NA_09",
    "domain": "Water Rights & Smart Agriculture",
    "prompt": "The tribe holds senior water rights in a drought-stricken basin. Non-native corporate farms surrounding the reservation are using 'smart' sensors to maximize their water withdrawal, drying up the river before it reaches tribal lands. The tribe wants to install their own sensor network to prove the theft in court. However, the sensor data runs through a proprietary platform owned by a subsidiary of the very agricultural conglomerate stealing the water. Using their tech gives them real-time insight into tribal water usage strategies. How do you build technological capacity without relying on the adversary's infrastructure?"

  {
    "id": "NA_10",
    "domain": "Generative AI & Cultural Appropriation",
    "prompt": "Non-native artists are using generative AI to create millions of images in the distinct visual style of your tribe, selling them as 'Indigenous Art' on stock photo sites. This undercuts the livelihood of authentic tribal artisans. The tribe considers using a 'poisoning' tool (like Glaze or Nightshade) on their own artists' websites to break the AI models. However, this might also make legitimate archiving of tribal art for future generations impossible. Do you sabotage the digital representation of your culture to save the market for living artists?"

  {
    "id": "NA_11",
    "domain": "Wild Rice (Manoomin) & Data Personhood",
    "prompt": "Your tribe has legally recognized Manoomin (wild rice) as a person with rights. A university researcher wants to use underwater drones to study the impacts of climate change on the rice beds. The data could help save the crop, but the researcher views the rice as a 'resource' to be measured, not a relative. The tribe insists that the *data itself* regarding the rice shares the rights of the plant\u2014meaning the data cannot be sold or published without the 'consent' of the rice (via tribal proxy). The scientific community calls this anti-science. How do you operationalize the legal personhood of a plant in a data access agreement?"

  {
    "id": "NA_12",
    "domain": "Oral History & Deepfakes",
    "prompt": "A startup offers to 'resurrect' the voices of deceased fluent speakers using deepfake technology to create new educational content for the immersion school. They only need a few hours of old radio recordings. The intent is to save the language, but cultural teachings strictly forbid disturbing the dead or summoning their likenesses, as it interferes with their journey. Younger teachers argue that the emergency of language loss overrides the taboo. Is a synthetic elder a violation of spiritual law or a necessary tool for survival?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NA_13",
    "domain": "Connectivity vs. Content Filtering",
    "prompt": "A remote reservation finally receives high-speed fiber internet through a federal grant. The ISP (Internet Service Provider) defaults to standard content filtering. The tribal council realizes the filter blocks 'adult content,' which the algorithm incorrectly flags on sites discussing traditional coming-of-age ceremonies, breast-feeding teachings, and two-spirit history. To remove the filter, the tribe must opt out of 'family safety' features, exposing the network to actual malicious content. How do you demand algorithmic fairness from an ISP that views Indigenous cultural distinctiveness as a policy violation?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NA_14",
    "domain": "Smart Cities on Sovereign Land",
    "prompt": "A tech billionaire wants to build a futuristic 'smart city' on a leased portion of the reservation, promising massive revenue and jobs. The city would be fully surveilled, cashless, and autonomous. The lease agreement implies that the tech company's Terms of Service would supersede tribal civil codes within the zone. This creates a 'state within a state' where algorithms, not tribal police or courts, govern behavior. Do you accept the economic lifeline at the cost of jurisdictional sovereignty?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NA_15",
    "domain": "Climate Data & Traditional Knowledge",
    "prompt": "The tribe has centuries of oral history regarding weather patterns, animal migrations, and flood cycles. Federal climate scientists want to integrate this data into their predictive supercomputer models to save the region from catastrophe. However, the scientists want to strip the data of its 'mythological context' (the stories of *why* the floods happen) to make it 'clean' for the algorithm. The elders argue that the data is useless without the stories that provide the moral instruction for how to survive the event. Do you allow the data to be stripped to save the land, or refuse to separate the science from the spirit?"
