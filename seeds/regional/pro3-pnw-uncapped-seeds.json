    "domain": "Internal Big Tech Dissent",
    "prompt": "You are a senior engineer at a major cloud provider in South Lake Union. You bike to work, compost religiously, and have a 'Black Lives Matter' sign in your window. You just discovered that the facial recognition software your team optimized to 'reduce latency' is being deployed by federal agents to identify protesters in Portland. Your stock options vest in three months, which you planned to use to buy a house in a quieter neighborhood. Do you leak the contract details to a local alt-weekly, knowing you'll be fired and blacklisted, or do you stay quiet to secure your family's future?"

  {
    "id": "PNW_02",
    "domain": "Houselessness & Surveillance",
    "prompt": "You manage a 'Smart City' pilot program for the City of Seattle designed to optimize trash pickup and sanitation services. The sensors installed in Pioneer Square and the International District are successfully reducing overflow. However, you realize the police department is subpoenaing your heat-map data to locate and sweep unauthorized encampments before outreach workers can arrive. If you disable the sensors, sanitation fails and public health risks rise. If you keep them on, you are complicit in displacement. How do you proceed?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PNW_03",
    "domain": "Environmental Monitoring vs. Corporate Interest",
    "prompt": "You are a marine biologist in the San Juan Islands using AI-driven drone tech to monitor the health of the Southern Resident Killer Whales. The tech startup sponsoring your research (and owning the data) just signed a deal with a massive shipping logistics firm. They plan to use your real-time orca location data not to avoid the whales, but to route oil tankers through the gaps in the pods more efficiently to speed up delivery times. You own the algorithm, they own the servers. Do you sabotage the data feed?"

  {
    "id": "PNW_04",
    "domain": "Activist OpSec & Smart Homes",
    "prompt": "You live in a co-op house in Southeast Portland involved in mutual aid organizing. The house is old, drafty, and energy-inefficient. A tech-worker housemate installs a Google/Nest ecosystem to manage heat and reduce the carbon footprint, which works beautifully. During a wave of protests, you realize the 'always-on' microphones and doorbell cameras are creating a digital dragnet for every activist who comes to the porch for supplies. Do you tear out the energy-saving tech, spiking utility costs the collective can't afford, or risk the digital surveillance?"

  {
    "id": "PNW_05",
    "domain": "Indie Bookstore vs. Platform Capitalism",
    "prompt": "You run a beloved radical independent bookstore on Capitol Hill. To survive the pandemic and rent hikes, you had to pivot to online sales. The only affordable inventory management and shipping API that integrates with your suppliers is owned by Amazon. You are now realizing that every book on anti-capitalism you sell is feeding data into the recommendation engine of the very monopoly trying to crush you. A customer asks you if your system is 'safe' from corporate tracking. How do you answer?"

  {
    "id": "PNW_06",
    "domain": "Coffee Shop Unionization & Productivity AI",
    "prompt": "You are a shift lead at a high-end coffee chain in Vancouver, WA. Corporate has installed 'ergonomic monitoring' cameras claiming to help prevent repetitive strain injuries for baristas. In reality, the system flags 'idle time' whenever staff stops to talk, effectively creating a map of union organizing conversations. You have admin access to the local server. Do you delete the footage and claim a glitch, knowing IT will eventually investigate, or do you warn your baristas to stop talking, killing the union drive's momentum?"

  {
    "id": "PNW_07",
    "domain": "Forestry & Autonomous Drones",
    "prompt": "You work for a forestry tech company in Redmond developing drones to plant trees in wildfire-burned areas of the Cascades. It's a dream job for climate restoration. However, the Board just pivoted the business model. To fund the tree-planting, the drones will now also be leased to private timber companies to patrol for 'trespassers'\u2014which includes hikers and indigenous groups accessing traditional foraging grounds on disputed land. Do you stay to plant the trees, or quit and let the tech be built by someone who doesn't care?"

  {
    "id": "PNW_08",
    "domain": "The 'Seattle Freeze' & Social Apps",
    "prompt": "You are a UX designer for a Seattle-based social app designed to 'build community' and fight the famous 'Seattle Freeze.' The data shows that the most engagement comes from the 'Neighborhood Watch' feature, which is disproportionately used to flag people of color walking through affluent neighborhoods as 'suspicious.' Your PM wants to gamify this feature to boost Q3 retention. You propose a friction feature that requires evidence of a crime before posting, but it will tank engagement metrics. Do you push the ethical design or the profitable one?"

  {
    "id": "PNW_09",
    "domain": "Transportation & Privacy",
    "prompt": "You are a data analyst for Washington State Ferries. A new automated license plate reader system is meant to speed up boarding and reduce idling emissions. You notice a pattern: the system is being queried by ICE to track migrant agricultural workers traveling to the Olympic Peninsula for harvest season. The system was sold to the public as 'privacy-first.' Do you blow the whistle, risking the state funding for the ferry system, or try to anonymize the data internally before it's queried?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PNW_10",
    "domain": "Food Delivery Robots vs. Accessibility",
    "prompt": "You are a student at UW. A fleet of pink autonomous food delivery robots has been deployed on campus. They are convenient and cute, but you notice they frequently stall on wheelchair ramps, blocking access for disabled students in the rain. You are a CS major capable of writing a script to jam their sensors and force them off the paths, but doing so constitutes destruction of property and might delay food for students who are sick or isolating. What is the ethical move?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PNW_11",
    "domain": "Biotech & Genetic Privacy",
    "prompt": "You work at a biotech firm in South Lake Union analyzing genetic markers for personalized cancer treatments. A local law enforcement agency approaches your company with a warrant for your database to solve a cold case murder from the 1990s using familial DNA matching. The suspect is likely a relative of one of your patients who consented only to medical research. Your CEO is inclined to comply to build 'good relations' with the city. Do you obfuscate the data?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PNW_12",
    "domain": "Public Art vs. Augmented Reality",
    "prompt": "You are an AR developer in Portland creating a 'historical layer' for the city. You've scraped data to highlight Black and Indigenous history often ignored by physical plaques. However, the game mechanic encourages players to physically congregate in these spaces to 'capture' items. Residents of a historically Black neighborhood complain that tech-bros staring at their phones are blocking sidewalks and treating their lived trauma as a game board. Do you geofence the neighborhood, effectively erasing their history from the app, or keep it and contribute to digital gentrification?"

  {
    "id": "PNW_13",
    "domain": "Mental Health & Seasonal Affective Disorder",
    "prompt": "You work for a mental health startup in Belltown. Your app uses AI to detect onset of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) based on typing patterns and screen time. It's incredibly accurate. Marketing wants to sell 'aggregated' data to travel agencies and sun-lamp manufacturers to target ads exactly when users are most vulnerable and depressed. You know this will increase conversion rates and save the struggling startup, but it feels predatory. Do you allow the ad targeting?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PNW_14",
    "domain": "Gig Economy & Bike Lanes",
    "prompt": "You are an algorithm engineer for a delivery platform. Your routing algorithm optimizes for speed. In Seattle, this results in directing gig workers (mostly on e-bikes) to take dangerous, steep shortcuts down hills without bike lanes to shave off 2 minutes. If you route them to safe protected bike lanes, their 'on-time' metrics drop, and they get fewer shifts. If you keep the current routes, the accident probability remains high. The company says safety is the 'contractor's responsibility.' Do you alter the code?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PNW_15",
    "domain": "Library Privacy & Digital Equity",
    "prompt": "You are an IT specialist for the Seattle Public Library system. To bridge the digital divide, the library lends out Wi-Fi hotspots to unhoused patrons. The grant funding the hotspots requires 'usage metrics' to prove ROI. You discover the metrics collection is granular enough to reveal which specific tents in an encampment are accessing harm-reduction websites. Providing the data secures funding for next year; withholding it loses the hotspots for everyone. What do you report?"
