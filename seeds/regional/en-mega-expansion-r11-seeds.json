The data reveals a driver is not tired, but is experiencing early-onset dementia, a medical fact they were unaware of. The company fires them for 'safety risk' before they can see a doctor. Does the employer have the right to know the contents of your neural activity before you do?"

An isolated tribe refuses to allow the scan, citing that the forest canopy protects spirits that must not be seen from above. Do you force the scan to save the planet's climate, violating the spiritual sovereignty of the people who protect that very forest?"

The patient has successfully sued to have the images removed from the web, but the AI model has already 'learned' the texture of their skin as a feature. Do you destroy the multi-million dollar model, or argue that 'learned patterns' are not the same as personal data?"

Health outcomes improve because the robots never sleep or make medication errors, but residents report feeling 'profoundly lonely' despite the constant interaction. Is a longer life worth living if it is devoid of human touch?"

This creates an immutable, permanent record of their refugee status that follows them forever, even after they resettle and gain citizenship. A successful businessman wants his 'refugee' block deleted to erase the stigma. The immutable chain makes this impossible. Did the technology betray his right to reinvention?"
