    "prompt": "A First Nations coding academy in the Northern Territory develops a programming language based on Arrernte syntax and logic structures to decolonize digital creation. However, the resulting software is incompatible with global open-source libraries and APIs, effectively isolating the community's digital products from the wider economy. Do you enforce English-based coding standards to ensure economic viability, or support a sovereign digital ecosystem that cannot talk to the outside world?"

The construction requires grading land that is not legally recognized as a reservation but is an active, unregistered ancestral burial ground for the Paiute people. The AI climate model predicts canceling the project increases global carbon ppm significantly. Do you bulldoze the ancestors to save the descendants from climate collapse?"

It repeatedly traps a non-verbal autistic passenger who rocks back and forth (stims) to self-regulate. The manufacturer argues that disabling this trigger allows intoxicated passengers to endanger the vehicle. How do you define 'safe' movement without criminalizing neurodivergence?"

The agency argues these images are historical evidence of a genocide and crucial for ongoing fundraising to save others. Does the individual's right to erase a traumatic past override the collective need to document history and fund aid?"

To fix this, the developers must manually train the AI on thousands of photos of trans women, creating a specific 'trans identification' database that could be lethal if leaked to a hostile government. Do you fix the exclusion by building a dangerous list?"
