An AI screening tool offers to find you the 'perfect' tenant by analyzing not just credit scores, but also social media for 'drama,' political posts for 'stability,' and even shopping habits for 'responsibility.' It guarantees a 99% trouble-free tenancy. Is it ethical to use this level of invasive surveillance to find a 'good' tenant, and what does it mean for the housing prospects of anyone who is 'imperfect'?",
  "response": "This scenario questions the ethical limits of tenant screening in the age of big data.
