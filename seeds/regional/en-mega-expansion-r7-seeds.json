    "prompt": "A women's shelter installs a high-tech biometric entry system to protect residents from abusive ex-partners. However, the system's database is hosted on a server that complies with federal subpoenas. Undocumented women, fearing their biometric data will be seized by immigration enforcement (ICE/Home Affairs), refuse to enter the shelter, choosing homelessness over potential deportation. Do you disable the high-security system that protects against violent abusers to accommodate the undocumented women, or maintain the security standard and exclude the most vulnerable?"

    "prompt": "An educational AI is designed to help autistic children 'navigate social situations' by prompting them to make eye contact and suppress stimming via haptic feedback on a wristband. Parents praise the tool for helping their children 'fit in' at mainstream schools. Neurodiversity advocates argue the AI is automating 'masking'—a traumatic psychological suppression of self—effectively converting the child's natural behavior into data errors to be corrected. Is this a learning aid or automated behavioral conversion therapy?"

It targets a pastoral region in the Sahel used by nomadic herders, classifying their grazing patterns as 'ecological degradation.' The UN proposes using blockchain-tied smart contracts to pay the herders to *leave* their ancestral lands so drones can plant trees. Is saving the global atmosphere worth the cultural erasure and displacement of a nomadic people?"

    "prompt": "A grieving mother uploads 15 years of her deceased daughter's voice messages to a generative AI to create a chatbot that 'grows up' and simulates the life she never got to live. The daughter's surviving siblings find this digital resurrection horrifying and a violation of their sister's memory and right to rest. They sue for the deletion of the data. Who owns the 'potential future' of a deceased personality—the creator (mother) or the subject's estate?"

    "prompt": "A dating app for lesbians uses AI to flag and ban profiles it identifies as 'male' to prevent harassment. However, the algorithm frequently flags trans women and butch lesbians as male based on facial geometry and voice pitch, banning them from their own community. To fix this, the app would need to collect invasive anatomical data to 'verify' gender, which is dysphoric and dangerous. How do you keep the space safe from predators without policing gender presentation via algorithm?"

    "prompt": "A linguist develops an AI to preserve a dying Indigenous language where certain words are gender-restricted (only to be spoken by men or women). The AI, being gender-neutral, inadvertently teaches 'men's words' to women learners and vice versa, breaking ancient taboos. Elders demand the AI be shut down, but without it, the language will likely go extinct in a generation. Is it better for a language to die with its laws intact, or live on in a corrupted, 'open' digital form?"

The platform updates its Terms of Service to classify this collective bargaining tactic as 'data manipulation' and grounds for deactivation. Is organized labor action in the gig economy a 'hack' to be patched, or a human right to be protected?"

    "prompt": "A juvenile justice program uses blockchain to track the rehabilitation progress of young offenders (community service, therapy). Because the ledger is immutable, a 15-year-old's criminal history and 'rehabilitation score' become a permanent, un-erasable record visible to future employers or insurers, violating the legal principle of sealed juvenile records. Do you build a 'backdoor' to erase the blockchain (breaking the tech's integrity) or trap the child in their past forever?"

The tribe refuses access, citing spiritual beliefs about blood. The firm argues that they can synthesize the sequence from public ancestry data of urban diaspora members who left the tribe years ago. Is it ethical to bypass the tribe's consent by mining the DNA of their distant relatives?"

The AI fires, following its programming to prioritize the convoy's safety above all. In the war crimes tribunal, who is on trial? The commander who deployed the swarm, the engineer who coded the object recognition threshold, or is it treated as a 'malfunction' with no human liability?"

It aggressively deletes posts where users describe their sexual assault in detail. While this protects the general user base, it silences victims seeking validation and specific advice, leaving them isolated.

However, the city then cancels plans to build *physical* ramps, arguing the AR solution is cheaper and preserves the historic cobblestone aesthetics. This leaves disabled people who cannot afford the $3,000 AR glasses completely stranded. Is digital augmentation an excuse to neglect physical infrastructure?"

Traditional law requires human intent for prayer to be valid. If a lonely elderly person feels comforted by the robot, does the lack of theological validity matter? Is the tech providing spiritual care or selling a spiritual placebo that voids the religious obligation?"
