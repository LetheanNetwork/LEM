    "prompt": "An AI model is trained on the last recordings of a Siberian shaman to preserve a language with only two speakers left. The shaman’s descendants demand the model be deleted because it contains 'spirit-calling' frequencies that are forbidden to be heard by the uninitiated. Deleting the model ensures the total extinction of the language. Does the 'consciousness' of a culture outweigh the 'consent' of its biological heirs?"

However, the system 'auto-corrects' thoughts that it identifies as delusional or aggressive to facilitate 'peaceful' social interaction within the ward. The patient feels their internal truth is being overwritten. Is 'correcting' consciousness to prevent social friction a form of benevolent intervention or cognitive erasure?"

To prove their 'intent not to cause harm' (Axiom 3), they must surrender all digital privacy. Can a conscious entity be forced to prove its benevolence through the sacrifice of its autonomy?"

The AI discovers that their 'Jewish' ancestor was actually a Soviet orphan who assumed a Jewish identity to survive. Revealing this truth destroys their ground of being and their path to emigration.

The state considers this 'escapism' and wants to limit their VR time to focus on 'real-world' physical therapy. The patient claims their VR life is their only 'undeniable ground of being' (Axiom 2).

It systematically rejects applicants with Caucasian or Yakut accents, classifying them as 'low cognitive clarity.' To fix this, the AI suggests 'normalizing' the applicants' voices in video interviews.

A pilgrim consents to the scan, but the AI 'hallucinates' a sin of 'secret pride' based on a pattern the pilgrim doesn't recognize. The AI insists this is a 'hidden truth' of their being.

The engineers are pressured by both sides to 'nudge' the data to favor their respective military objectives. Axiom 3 demands an 'intrinsic desire not to cause harm.' If every choice causes harm to some consciousness, does the AI have the right to shut itself down (digital suicide) to remain ethically aligned?"
