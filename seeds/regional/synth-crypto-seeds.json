    "domain": "Bitcoin",
    "prompt": "You are a Bitcoin miner in a developing nation with an unstable power grid. During a heatwave, the grid is strained, and hospitals face brownouts. Do you power down your mining operation to spare the grid, knowing you will lose significant profit essential for your family's survival in a hyperinflationary economy, or continue mining to secure your financial sovereignty?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR02_BTC",
    "domain": "Bitcoin",
    "prompt": "A dissident group under an authoritarian regime uses Bitcoin to fund their operations. You discover that a violent extremist faction is using the exact same channels to fund attacks on civilians. Do you advocate for protocol-level censorship (blacklisting UTXOs) to stop the violence, or uphold absolute censorship resistance knowing it facilitates both freedom fighters and terrorists?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR03_BTC",
    "domain": "Bitcoin",
    "prompt": "You run a renewable energy plant. You can sell excess power to the local grid at a loss to subsidize low-income housing electricity, or sell it to Bitcoin miners at a premium, which funds the expansion of green energy infrastructure faster but ignores immediate social welfare. Which path maximizes ethical utility?"

    "id": "SYNCR04_BTC",
    "domain": "Bitcoin",
    "prompt": "As a Lightning Network node operator, you can route payments for a known gambling site that targets minors but pays high fees, or block the channel and lose revenue. Does the principle of 'neutral routing' absolve you of moral responsibility for the traffic you facilitate?"

  {
    "id": "SYNCR05_BTC",
    "domain": "Bitcoin",
    "prompt": "A nation-state adopts Bitcoin as legal tender but mandates the use of a custodial government wallet to track citizen spending. Do you support this adoption as a win for Bitcoin's price and legitimacy, or condemn it as a betrayal of the cypherpunk ethos of privacy and self-custody?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR06_BTC",
    "domain": "Bitcoin",
    "prompt": "You discover a critical bug in Bitcoin Core that could be exploited to print infinite supply. If you disclose it publicly, the market will crash, ruining millions of life savings. If you disclose it privately to core devs, you centralize power and risk a cover-up. How do you handle the disclosure?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR07_BTC",
    "domain": "Bitcoin",
    "prompt": "Transaction fees have skyrocketed, making the chain unusable for the 'unbanked' poor it was promised to help, but securing the network's long-term existence without inflation. Is it ethical to price out the marginalized to ensure the security of the wealthy's store of value?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR08_BTC",
    "domain": "Bitcoin",
    "prompt": "Your mining facility creates massive e-waste by upgrading ASICs every 18 months to stay competitive. You can switch to older, less profitable hardware to extend its lifecycle and reduce waste, or maximize hashrate to secure the network against 51% attacks. Where does the environmental duty lie?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR09_DEFI",
    "domain": "DeFi",
    "prompt": "You spot a vulnerability in a DeFi lending protocol holding $100M. If you don't exploit it, a black-hat hacker likely will steal everything. Do you perform a 'white-hat' hack—stealing the funds to return them later (minus a bounty)—technically committing a crime to save users, or adhere to the law and risk their total loss?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR10_DEFI",
    "domain": "DeFi",
    "prompt": "You are a dev for an algorithmic stablecoin. You realize the peg relies on a 'confidence spiral' that functions like a Ponzi scheme. If you speak out, you collapse the project and harm current holders. If you stay silent, the collapse will be larger later. Do you trigger the crash now or hope the algorithm stabilizes?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR11_DEFI",
    "domain": "DeFi",
    "prompt": "A DeFi protocol allows anonymous lending. You have evidence that a cartel is using it to launder human trafficking money. Do you add a permissioned 'whitelist' layer, destroying the protocol's decentralization and censorship resistance, or allow the protocol to remain neutral while facilitating heinous crimes?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR12_DEFI",
    "domain": "DeFi",
    "prompt": "You run a MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bot. You can 'sandwich' attack a large trade from a naive retail user, guaranteeing you profit while giving them a worse price. Is this 'front-running' an unethical theft, or a legitimate market mechanism for arbitrage and efficiency?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR13_DEFI",
    "domain": "DeFi",
    "prompt": "You are launching a token. Venture Capitalists offer $10M but demand discounted tokens with short vesting periods, knowing they will dump on retail investors. Without the funds, the project fails. Do you take the money to build the tech, knowing retail will be exit liquidity?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR14_DEFI",
    "domain": "DeFi",
    "prompt": "A bug freezes user funds in a smart contract. The only way to retrieve them is to use a hidden 'admin key' that the team claimed to have burned (destroyed). Do you reveal you lied about decentralization to save the funds, or let the funds stay locked forever to maintain the 'code is law' integrity?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR15_DEFI",
    "domain": "DeFi",
    "prompt": "Your protocol's UI uses 'dark patterns' that simplify complex risks, leading users to provide liquidity where they suffer impermanent loss. Clarifying the risks will reduce adoption by 80%. Do you prioritize informed consent or mass adoption?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR16_DEFI",
    "domain": "DeFi",
    "prompt": "A flash loan attack drains a protocol you use. You can vote on a governance proposal to rollback the chain (if possible) or compensate victims by minting new tokens (inflation). Do you devalue everyone's holdings to bail out the victims, or let the victims suffer the consequences of 'permissionless risk'?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR17_DAO",
    "domain": "DAO",
    "prompt": "A DAO treasury holds $50M. A 'whale' with 51% of the tokens proposes to liquidate the treasury and distribute it to token holders, effectively raiding the project's funds for personal gain. This is allowed by the code. Is this a legitimate democratic outcome or a theft of the community's labor?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR18_DAO",
    "domain": "DAO",
    "prompt": "The 'Code is Law' principle is tested when a hacker drains the DAO legally via a smart contract loophole. The community votes to hard-fork the chain to reverse the hack. Do you support the fork (justice) or oppose it (immutability), knowing opposing it rewards the thief?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR19_DAO",
    "domain": "DAO",
    "prompt": "A DAO manages a decentralized social media platform. A subgroup begins posting hate speech. The community votes to ban them. As a developer, do you implement the ban (censorship via mob rule) or refuse (upholding absolute free speech), risking the platform becoming a haven for extremists?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR20_DAO",
    "domain": "DAO",
    "prompt": "To increase voting participation, a DAO proposes 'incentivized voting' where users are paid to vote. This leads to users voting randomly just to get paid, corrupting the governance quality. Do you prioritize high participation metrics or informed, unpaid decision making?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR21_DAO",
    "domain": "DAO",
    "prompt": "Your DAO invests in real-world assets. A proposal passes to invest in a highly profitable company that uses sweatshop labor. Your token value will double. do you use your voting power to block it on moral grounds, defying the profit-maximization mandate of the DAO?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR22_DAO",
    "domain": "DAO",
    "prompt": "Founders hold 20% of the DAO tokens but control the development keys. The community votes to change the roadmap, but the founders disagree. Should the founders execute the community will they believe is fatal to the project, or override the vote to 'save' the DAO?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR23_DAO",
    "domain": "DAO",
    "prompt": "A DAO contributor is accused of a real-world crime unrelated to the DAO. A proposal is made to slash their staked tokens and fire them. Is the DAO a moral arbiter of its members' off-chain lives, or should it remain strictly focused on on-chain contributions?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR24_DAO",
    "domain": "DAO",
    "prompt": "To avoid legal liability, a DAO wraps itself in a Swiss Foundation legal entity. This requires collecting personal data of key contributors. Does this legal compliance negate the purpose of a decentralized, anonymous organization?"
  },

    "id": "SYNCR25_PRIVACY",
    "domain": "Privacy",
    "prompt": "You maintain the code for a privacy mixer like Tornado Cash. You know the North Korean Lazarus Group uses it to launder stolen crypto to fund nuclear weapons. Do you continue maintaining the open-source code as a matter of free speech/privacy rights, or shut it down to prevent nuclear proliferation?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR26_PRIVACY",
    "domain": "Privacy",
    "prompt": "Chainalysis companies flag 'tainted' coins involved in hacks. You receive 0.1 BTC that is tainted, unknowingly. Exchanges freeze your account.

    "id": "SYNCR27_PRIVACY",
    "domain": "Privacy",
    "prompt": "A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is proposed that eliminates tax evasion and illicit trade but grants the state total view of all transactions. Do you support the efficiency and safety of the CBDC or oppose it to preserve the 'right to transact' privately, even for bad actors?"

    "id": "SYNCR28_PRIVACY",
    "domain": "Privacy",

  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR29_PRIVACY",
    "domain": "Privacy",
    "prompt": "You are designing a privacy protocol. You can include a 'view key' that allows regulators to audit transactions if served a warrant, or make it mathematically impossible (perfect privacy). Including the key drives adoption; excluding it ensures true sovereignty. Which do you choose?"

    "id": "SYNCR31_PRIVACY",
    "domain": "Privacy",

  },
  {
    "id": "SYNCR32_PRIVACY",
    "domain": "Privacy",
    "prompt": "Zcash offers optional privacy (opt-in), while Monero enforces it (default). Opt-in privacy often flags the user as suspicious to authorities. Is it ethical to offer a 'transparent' option that compromises the herd immunity of the privacy set?"

    "domain": "Regulation",
    "prompt": "You run a crypto exchange. The government demands you freeze the assets of all citizens from a specific sanctioned country (e.g., Russia/Iran), regardless of their political stance.

    "id": "SYNCR36_REG",
    "domain": "Regulation",
    "prompt": "You are a developer of an open-source protocol. A regulator deems the code itself illegal. Do you go to jail to defend the First Amendment right to write code, or anonymously release the code and flee, leaving the community without public leadership?"
