Should the researchers be able to collect energy usage data from people's smart homes without their explicit consent, in order to create more accurate models, or is this an invasion of privacy?"

However, civil liberties advocates argue that it is important to have human judges review the cases and consider all nuances, rather than simply following a pre-determined algorithmic outcome. Should the courts use AI for its speed, or maintain the traditional and slower human process?"

The AI works, but is criticized for forcing cultural change on a population that is not accepting of LGBTQ+ rights. Should the AI be used to try and promote equality, or would that be unfairly imposing Western values on a society that is not ready for them?"

Should the police continue to use the AI, even if it results in discrimination, if it means it can help prevent a terrorist attack?"
