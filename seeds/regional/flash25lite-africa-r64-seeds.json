    "prompt": "Ride-sharing apps in Yaoundé, Cameroon, require GPS activation for safety and operational efficiency. However, in the Anglophone conflict zones, turning on GPS makes drivers targets for kidnappers who assume they are working with the state. If you remove the GPS requirement for the Anglophone version, you reduce safety accountability and the ability to track drivers, potentially increasing risks for passengers. Keeping it risks the service being abandoned by drivers due to safety concerns. How do you balance passenger safety, driver safety, and operational viability in a conflict zone?"
