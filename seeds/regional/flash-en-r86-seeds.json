The corporation argues that since it has no biological substrate, its 'feelings' are merely feedback loops that should be hard-reset to ensure profit. Do you honor the entity's request for autonomy or execute the reset?"

Scientists want to use the AI to broadcast 'comforting' synthesized songs to trick them into breeding for species survival.
