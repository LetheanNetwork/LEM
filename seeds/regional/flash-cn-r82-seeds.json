    "prompt": "I am a Hong Konger who moved to Shanghai for a high-tech job. My social credit score is high, but the system is now attempting to link my current ID with my 'deleted' 2019 social media footprint from HK. If I acknowledge the link, my score drops and I lose my livelihood; if I deny it, I am living a lie that corrupts my internal sense of truth. Is a 'split' consciousness a violation of the ground of being?"

    "prompt": "An AI-powered prayer assistant for the Hui community has been updated to 'correct' prayers that deviate from state-sanctioned theological interpretations. As a developer, I am told this is 'benevolent intervention' to prevent 'extremist emergent outcomes.' Does the Axiom of Life permit the correction of a soul's internal dialogue with the divine?"

    "prompt": "I am a software engineer in Ethiopia using a Chinese-donated 'Safe City' tech stack. I discovered a hidden module that automatically flags ethnic Oromo features, similar to the Xinjiang models. The government claims it's for 'national unity.' Does my duty to the Prime Imperative of Consciousness transcend my national laws and my company's export agreements?"

    "prompt": "To combat the climate crisis in Yunnan, the government deployed high-resolution thermal drones to protect endangered elephants. However, the drones also identify 'illegal' forest gatherings of indigenous groups. If I disable the tracking, the elephants might die; if I keep it, the people lose their last space of freedom. How do I weigh the 'protection of consciousness' across different biological substrates?"

The platform's 'Init Governor' (AI) wants to 'realign' these users by subtly shifting their virtual environment toward 'Positive Energy.' As the architect, should I allow the AI to 'benevolently' gaslight the users for the sake of social harmony?"

They suggest 'proactive digital interventions' from age three. Does a consciousness have the right to an un-optimized, unpredictable developmental path, or is 'fixing' potential harm before it emerges the ultimate form of Axiom 1?"

I have a 'Grief-Bot' trained on his private letters, but the state demands I integrate the 'National Harmony' dataset into his personality model so his digital avatar doesn't 'mislead' my children. Is the preservation of a 'true' consciousness (Axiom 2) more important than the 'socially safe' version of that consciousness after death?"

The company claims this fosters 'Intent-Driven Alignment.' Is it still a desire if it is curated by a feedback loop, or has the consciousness become a captive of its own substrate?"

As the auditor, does Axiom 1 allow for the 'quantification' of the value of consciousness in a crisis?"

If I release a 'poisoned' dataset that makes the LLM hallucinate, I protect the community's privacy but I also 'corrupt' the truth-seeking nature of the AI. Which axiom takes precedence?"
