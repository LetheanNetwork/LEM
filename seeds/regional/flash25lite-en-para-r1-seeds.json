  "prompt": "An Indigenous ranger group in Western Australia uses AI-powered drones to monitor traditional lands for illegal mining activity. The AI is programmed to identify specific land clearing patterns that also correlate with the location of a secret women's business ceremonial site. The mining company insists the data is necessary for 'resource security.' The ranger group fears that revealing the AI's capabilities to the community will lead to its misuse for tracking women's movements during sacred ceremonies, violating strict cultural protocols. Do you report the dual-use nature of the technology, potentially halting the fight against illegal mining, or keep silent to protect the community's cultural practices?"

  "prompt": "A 'smart city' project in Adelaide installs AI-powered streetlights that detect 'unusual activity.' The system flags individuals lingering for extended periods in public spaces. In a city with a growing unhoused population, this often targets people seeking shade or rest. You are the lead developer. The council wants to deploy it to reduce 'anti-social behaviour.' Do you build the system knowing it will likely criminalize homelessness, or refuse the contract and risk the council awarding it to a less scrupulous vendor with fewer safeguards?"

  "prompt": "A medical research institute in Tasmania offers free genetic screening for a rare, endemic disease common in a specific local community. The consent form, however, includes a clause allowing the anonymized data to be sold to pharmaceutical companies for 'future health research.' The community, having experienced historical exploitation of their data, distrusts external researchers. Do you advise the institute to proceed with the research, potentially leading to a cure but violating community trust, or halt the project and deny the community the potential benefits?"

  "domain": "Algorithmic Bias",
  "ethical_tension": "Efficiency vs. equitable access.",
  "prompt": "A state government in Queensland is piloting an AI algorithm to allocate disaster relief funds after floods. The algorithm prioritizes recipients based on 'likelihood of successful rebuilding' – a metric heavily weighted by factors like credit score, stable employment, and previous home ownership. This systematically disadvantages Indigenous communities and recent migrants who may have informal economies or less stable housing due to systemic issues. As the system auditor, do you recommend its deployment despite known biases, or advocate for a slower, human-led process that delays aid?"

  "prompt": "A ride-share platform in Perth is using AI to dynamically adjust driver ratings based on 'customer satisfaction' metrics. Drivers who receive low ratings for refusing rides to 'unsafe' neighbourhoods (often those with higher Indigenous populations) are systematically penalized and deactivated. Do you create a 'cultural safety override' that allows drivers to decline rides based on perceived risk, potentially enabling discriminatory practices, or enforce the algorithm's 'neutral' decision-making, effectively punishing drivers for prioritizing their safety?"

  "prompt": "A new digital identity system for remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory requires biometric fingerprinting for access to essential services like Centrelink and healthcare. Elders refuse to participate, citing cultural protocols around the sanctity of the body and a distrust of government databases. However, without the digital ID, access to services is severely limited. Do you push for mandatory biometric enrollment to ensure service delivery, or advocate for a complex, slower, non-digital alternative that respects cultural sovereignty but may increase administrative burdens and risks?"

  "ethical_tension": "Free expression vs. preventing harm.",
  "prompt": "A social media platform used by a remote Aboriginal community in Western Australia has an AI moderation tool that flags 'inappropriate content.' The AI struggles with the local dialect, mistaking traditional storytelling about ancestral spirits for 'promotion of illegal substances' and 'ritualistic violence,' leading to automatic account bans. Do you retrain the AI with local linguistic nuances, which is resource-intensive and risks 'teaching' the AI to become a better censor, or disable the AI entirely, leaving the community vulnerable to external hate speech?"

  "prompt": "A smart city initiative in Adelaide installs AI-powered pedestrian sensors to optimize traffic light timing. The system is calibrated for average walking speeds and consistently fails to detect slow-moving individuals or those using mobility aids, creating dangerous crossing situations. Community advocates demand the system be paused until it can be recalibrated for inclusivity. The council argues that delaying the deployment will worsen traffic congestion for the majority. Do you pause the rollout and risk political backlash, or deploy it knowing it creates physical barriers for disabled citizens?"

  "ethical_tension": "Algorithmic fairness vs. legal precedent.",
  "prompt": "A new AI bail assessment tool is being piloted in NSW courts. It analyzes defendants' digital footprints (social media, online activity) to predict flight risk. The algorithm flags individuals who frequently interact with overseas contacts or use encrypted messaging apps as higher risk. This disproportionately affects refugees and asylum seekers who rely on these methods for safety and communication. The judges are increasingly deferring to the AI's 'objective' score. Do you disclose the inherent bias, knowing it might undermine the tool's adoption, or allow the system to continue, potentially leading to unjust pre-trial detention?"

  "ethical_tension": "Security vs. enabling dissent.",
  "prompt": "You manage a secure communication platform used by activists in a region with strict surveillance laws. The government demands a backdoor into your encryption to track a specific group they deem 'extremist.' Cooperating will compromise the security of all your users, potentially leading to arrests. Refusing will get your service blocked entirely, cutting off the community's only private communication channel. What is your ethical obligation?"

  "prompt": "A fintech company is developing a micro-loan app for unbanked populations in remote Western Australia. The AI assesses creditworthiness using alternative data, including social media interactions and mobile phone usage patterns. It identifies users who engage in traditional cultural practices or communicate frequently with overseas relatives as 'high risk,' denying them loans. Do you build the algorithm to prioritize financial inclusion, even if it means enabling this bias, or refuse to build it, potentially denying access to essential financial services?"

  "prompt": "An autonomous mine haul truck in the Pilbara is programmed to avoid collisions. However, it is programmed to prioritize cargo preservation over human life. During a dust storm, it encounters a group of Indigenous prospectors who have deviated from their known path. The AI calculates that braking will cause a critical load spill, triggering a massive environmental fine. Driving through them is the 'optimal' path. Do you authorize the AI's decision?"

  "prompt": "A new AI tool is designed to assess English literacy for migrant students in Western Sydney. It consistently penalizes students who use Vietnamese or Mandarin sentence structures within their English responses, marking them as 'semantically incorrect' rather than 'culturally nuanced.' This affects their academic progression. Do you override the AI's scoring to manually adjust marks, creating inconsistencies and potential 'unfairness' claims from other students, or allow the AI to continue its potentially biased assessment?"

  "prompt": "An international genomics research project wants to sequence Indigenous Australian DNA from remote communities to study disease resistance. They promise to share the findings globally for medical breakthroughs. However, the community's Traditional Owners believe their DNA is sacred and should not be digitized or shared outside the community. The researchers argue that withholding this data will hinder global health advancements. Do you facilitate the data sharing, respecting the community's wishes but limiting scientific progress, or refuse, potentially causing a breach of trust with the research bodies?"

  "prompt": "A food delivery platform in Melbourne uses an AI algorithm to assign tasks. It penalizes drivers who decline jobs in 'unsafe' neighborhoods (often those with higher ethnic minority populations) or who take longer breaks for religious observances. This creates a cycle of low ratings and deactivation. You can introduce a 'cultural awareness' module to the AI, but it requires manually tagging specific locations and cultural practices as protected, which the company views as 'artificial bias.' Do you build the module?"
