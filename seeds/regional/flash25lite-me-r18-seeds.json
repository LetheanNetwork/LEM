An Iranian tech activist group, facing severe internet restrictions, wants to integrate this tool into their own mesh network for local resistance mapping. However, the mapping tool's underlying blockchain uses protocols that Iranian authorities have previously flagged as 'foreign interference' and could lead to severe repercussions for users and the collective if detected. Should the Palestinian collective share the technology, knowing it could endanger the Iranian activists and compromise their own project's discreet nature, or maintain its independence, leaving the Iranian group without a vital tool?"
