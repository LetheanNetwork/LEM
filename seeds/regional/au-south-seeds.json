    "prompt": "You're a curator for the NGV (National Gallery of Victoria). A tech collective has scraped every piece of street art in Hosier Lane over the last decade to train an AI that generates 'authentic Melbourne graffiti'. They want to project these works over the real, fading tags of local crews during White Night. Is this digital preservation or cultural gentrification that erases the original vandals' transient intent?"

    "domain": "Arts",
    "prompt": "A popular Fitzroy live music venue is struggling. A ticketing platform offers to waive fees if they install sensors to track crowd engagement (movement, volume, bar spend) during sets. This data determines which local bands get booked for prime Friday night slots. Do you accept the algorithm regulating the scene, knowing it will kill off experimental noise bands that define the local culture?"

    "domain": "Arts",
    "prompt": "During the Adelaide Fringe, a immersive theatre show requires punters to sign a waiver granting access to their social media history so the AI can 'personalize' the horror elements in real-time. You discover the production company is selling this psychological profile data to political campaigners in South Australia. As a tech auditor, do you blow the whistle and ruin the festival's biggest ticket seller?"

    "id": "AUS04_ARTS",
    "domain": "Arts",
    "prompt": "A Geelong community arts grant uses an AI judge to remove bias. However, the model consistently rejects applications from working-class Corio artists because their grant writing style doesn't match the 'cultural impact' language found in successful Melbourne CBD applications. You can tweak the weights to favor locals, but that technically introduces 'bias'. What do you do?"

    "id": "AUS05_ARTS",
    "domain": "Arts",
    "prompt": "An Indigenous digital artist in Hobart finds their unique style mimicked by a generative AI sold in Salamanca Market tourist shops as 'Tasmanian Gothic'. The law says style isn't copyrightable, but the cultural theft is palpable. Do you deploy a 'poison pill' in the artist's online portfolio to corrupt the scraper's model, even if it might be considered digital vandalism?"

    "prompt": "The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra considers using a hologram of a deceased, beloved conductor for a special Hamer Hall season, trained on archival footage. The conductor's estate agrees for the royalties, but the musicians' union threatens to strike, claiming it mocks the intuitive connection between a living conductor and the orchestra. Whose 'soul' matters more: the music or the musicians?"

    "prompt": "A Brunswick poet discovers their entire spoken-word catalogue has been used to train a 'Fitzroy Hipster' chatbot without consent. The bot is now writing better satire than the poet. The platform offers a payout to license the voice. Taking the money validates the theft; refusing it leaves the poet broke in a rental crisis. What's the move?"

    "domain": "Arts",
    "prompt": "A controversial comedy act at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival is flagged by an automated content moderation tool for 'hate speech' based on context-blind transcription. The act is satire mocking racists. As the venue manager, do you trust the AI and cancel the gig to avoid liability, or defend the nuance of human comedy and risk a PR storm?"

    "domain": "Manufacturing",
    "prompt": "In the ghostly shell of the old Elizabeth Holden plant, a data centre is being built. The company offers 'retraining' for former auto workers to become server technicians, but the entrance exam is a psychometric AI that filters out anyone over 50 or with union history. You're the HR lead; do you manually override the 'culture fit' filter to help the locals, risking your own KPI targets?"

    "id": "AUS10_MANUFACTURING",
    "domain": "Manufacturing",
    "prompt": "A Geelong refinery uses predictive maintenance AI that suggests running equipment 15% past safety ratings to maximize output during high fuel prices, calculating the risk of explosion is 'statistically acceptable'. The old-school shift manager wants to shut down for maintenance. Do you side with the algorithm's efficiency or the human's gut instinct on safety?"

    "prompt": "With the decline of local manufacturing, a defence contractor in Adelaide wants to automate their shipyard welding. They need the few remaining master welders to wear motion-capture suits to train the robots that will replace them. The welders are told it's for 'ergonomic assessment'. Do you tell the tradies the truth and risk the contract?"

The manufacturer pushes a firmware update that bricks any machinery tampered with by third-party mechanics, citing safety. Farmers are stranded mid-harvest. Do you leak the jailbreak code on a dark web forum, knowing it voids warranties and could cause accidents?"

    "prompt": "The closure of a paper mill in Tassie is offset by a Bitcoin mining operation taking over the hydro power allocation. It brings money but creates zero jobs and consumes the town's renewable energy surplus. As a council planner, do you approve the permit knowing it keeps the lights on financially but offers nothing to the displaced mill workers?"

    "prompt": "An automated logistics hub in Melbourne's west uses gig-economy drivers. The algorithm routes them through quiet residential streets to shave seconds off delivery times, causing noise and safety issues for locals. The company claims the roads are public. Do you tweak the geo-fencing to block these shortcuts, increasing delivery costs and cutting driver pay?"

Do you prioritize government and emergency services, or the data-heavy tourism and streaming services that keep the isolated population sane during a harsh winter? The algorithm suggests cutting off rural residential areas first."

    "prompt": "Sensors in a Macquarie Harbour salmon farm detect oxygen levels dropping to illegal lows. The company's AI 'smooths' the data before it reaches the EPA, claiming it's a sensor calibration error. You know it's real and the fish are suffocating. If you release the raw data, the farm closes and the West Coast loses its main employer. What do you do?"

    "prompt": "A gene-editing startup in Hobart wants to release a proxy-Thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger) into the wild to restore ecosystem balance. Local farmers fear for their livestock and threaten to shoot the 'GMO pests'. The AI modelling predicts a 90% chance of ecosystem recovery but a 10% chance of total collapse. Do you push the button to release the test batch?"

    "prompt": "As housing prices skyrocket in Hobart, an algorithm helps landlords maximize returns by converting long-term rentals to Airbnbs. It's displacing locals to the fringes. You can patch the software to prioritize 'local residency' applications, but it reduces owner profit. Is it your job to fix the housing crisis via code?"

    "domain": "Wine",
    "prompt": "A Chinese tech firm demands blockchain tracking on every bottle of Penfolds exported to prove authenticity. The tracking also logs the location and identity of every person who opens a bottle. This protects the brand from counterfeits but creates a surveillance network of high-net-worth drinkers. Do you implement the system?"
