    "prompt": "In a country with a backlogged court system, an AI is implemented to assign court dates. It prioritizes cases with high economic impact (e.g., commercial disputes, tax evasion) over human rights cases (e.g., land claims, gender-based violence). This is presented as maximizing 'societal value'. Should the weighting be changed to prioritize human rights cases, potentially slowing down economic recovery, or maintained to maximize economic efficiency, potentially sacrificing justice for the most vulnerable?"

    "prompt": "Social media is used to organize protests in Eswatini. The platform is pressured by the government to 'shadow-ban' protest hashtags or face a total ban of its services. Shadow-banning would reduce the visibility of the protests without completely silencing them, potentially allowing the platform to remain available for other communication. Should the platform agree to shadow-ban the hashtags to keep its services operational for the general population, thereby subtly censoring dissent, or refuse and risk a complete shutdown, silencing all users?"

The government uses this data to justify cutting waste collection services to that area, claiming it's 'less efficient'.

Debunking this lie with factual evidence might ensure the incumbent dictator wins the election, potentially leading to further oppression.

This forces many into debt and threatens their livelihoods. Should the system be paused or modified to include 'grace period' algorithms that account for economic hardship, potentially reducing government revenue and increasing administrative complexity, or maintained for efficiency, accepting the economic devastation it causes to the informal sector?"
