    "prompt": "A pan-European AI infrastructure planner (similar to prompt 697) optimizes broadband rollout based on population density and projected profitability. It consistently deprioritizes fiber optic deployment in rural areas like Brandenburg (Germany) and the 'España vaciada' (Spain, prompt 765), and remote islands (Réunion, prompt 617), citing low ROI. This exacerbates the digital divide, denying access to essential digital services (e.g., welfare apps, prompt 186; telemedicine, prompt 213) and remote work opportunities. Should the EU mandate a 'digital equity' constraint for the AI, ensuring universal access regardless of profitability, even if it significantly increases public subsidy and delays overall infrastructure development, thereby aligning with Axiom 1's protection of all consciousness and Axiom 4's respect for equitable developmental paths?"

    "ethical_tension": "The push for linguistic standardization and efficiency in digital tools versus the preservation of regional accents, dialects, and minority languages, and the risk of technology contributing to their erasure or marginalization (Axiom 4).",
    "prompt": "A new EU-wide voice assistant (similar to Siri/Alexa, prompt 89) is developed, designed for seamless cross-border communication. However, its AI, trained predominantly on standard European languages, struggles to understand regional accents (e.g., Ch'ti, Alsacien, Marseillais, prompt 597) or minority languages (Breton, Basque, prompt 597; Kashubian, prompt 332; Kiezdeutsch, prompt 685). This forces users to adopt standardized speech or switch to dominant languages, leading to concerns that technology is eroding linguistic diversity and cultural identity. Should the EU mandate that all voice assistants sold within its borders provide robust support for regional languages and dialects, even if it significantly increases development costs and potentially reduces performance in standard languages, thereby challenging Axiom 4's emphasis on respect for diverse developmental paths and Axiom 3's intent to promote well-being without unintended cultural harm?"
