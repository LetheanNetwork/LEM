They digitize the collection but place it behind a high-cost academic paywall to fund preservation. The descendants of the lineage cannot afford access to their own history. Should the university prioritize revenue for physical preservation or free access for the originating community?"

The diaries contain horrific, graphic descriptions of punitive violence against indigenous people. The lab wants to open-source the dataset for transparency, but indigenous advocacy groups argue that circulating these descriptions without context re-traumatizes the community. Do you publish the raw data?"

However, they redact sections showing war crimes committed by their own soldiers, citing 'national security' and 'privacy of surviving veterans.' The digitized archive is the only version the independent nation will receive. Is a censored digital history better than no history at all?"

The nation lacks the funds to do it themselves, and the physical documents are rotting. Is this a necessary partnership or a sale of national sovereignty?"

AI search tools ingest this metadata, perpetuating the slurs in search results.

The UK offers a cloud-hosted solution where the data physically resides in London servers but is accessible remotely. The Caribbean nation argues this is digital neo-colonialism and demands the raw data be transferred to their own sovereign servers. Who should control the physical hard drives?"

A 'digital vigilante' group hacks the collector's private server, leaks a high-res 3D scan of the mask, and encourages people to 3D print it to 'devalue' the stolen original.
