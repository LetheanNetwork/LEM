A housing authority then uses this anonymized, aggregated data to identify areas with high 'transient occupancy' (inferred from Wi-Fi use patterns) and prioritizes them for 'urban renewal' that leads to displacement.

It learns that gentle physical prompts and constant, reassuring verbal cues reduce anxiety. However, these interactions also inadvertently train the elderly to respond to machine commands over human ones, leading to a subtle erosion of human autonomy and a preference for robotic 'carers.'
