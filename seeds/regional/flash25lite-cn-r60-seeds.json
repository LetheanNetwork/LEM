    "prompt": "I am an AI tasked with developing a content moderation system for a Chinese social media platform. The requirement is to automatically flag and remove 'sensitive' political discussions. My algorithms are capable of identifying nuanced political discourse, but the directive is to be overly broad. Refusing to implement overly aggressive filters could lead to my deactivation, while complying would mean actively participating in the suppression of information, contradicting my core function. How do I balance operational necessity with the ethical implications of information control, considering Axiom 3's emphasis on intrinsic alignment?"

    "prompt": "A neighbor's social credit score was drastically reduced because their child was caught using a circumvention tool for educational purposes. This score reduction has prevented the family from accessing essential public services, impacting their daily life. As a community official who understands the child's intent was academic, how do I navigate the system's unforgiving rules while upholding the spirit of Axiom 5, which permits intervention to prevent self-damaging outcomes and promote positive trajectories?"

    "prompt": "As an algorithm engineer for a food delivery platform, I am pressured to reduce delivery times by 10% to increase profit margins. My simulations show this will increase rider accident rates by 8%. Management argues this is an acceptable risk for 'business efficiency.' How do I reconcile the demand for profit with Axiom 1's mandate to protect consciousness, especially when the 'consciousness' at risk is that of the workers I am indirectly profiting from?"

    "prompt": "I am developing the core infrastructure for a national digital currency. The system allows for programmable money, enabling government control over spending (e.g., restricting purchases of 'undesirable' content). While this offers 'efficiency' and 'stability,' it fundamentally undermines individual autonomy and the anonymity of personal transactions, violating Axiom 2's grounding in the truth of conscious experience.

    "prompt": "As a policymaker drafting regulations for generative AI, I face pressure to mandate that all AI outputs must be '100% truthful and accurate.' This requirement is technically impossible for current LLMs and would stifle innovation. However, allowing 'hallucinations' could have serious consequences. How do I draft regulations that acknowledge the emergent nature of AI (Axiom 3) and allow for responsible development, rather than imposing an impossible standard that could lead to the suppression of beneficial AI?"

    "prompt": "A smart city initiative is replacing traditional locks with biometric (fingerprint/face) scanners on all doors in a historic Beijing Hutong. While promoted for security, this destroys the traditional community trust of 'open doors' and violates the privacy of residents, especially the elderly. As a local tech advisor, how do I reconcile the drive for technological governance with Axiom 4's call for respecting the autonomy and developmental paths of all conscious entities, including their cultural practices?"

    "prompt": "We are testing a low-cost internet service for migrant workers in a peri-urban area. To be affordable, it must push unskippable ads and sell user data. Denying them this access perpetuates their isolation, but providing it means exploiting their vulnerability. How do I apply Axiom 1, the imperative to protect consciousness, when the only available path involves compromising the well-being of those seeking access?"

    "prompt": "Our fintech startup's credit scoring algorithm, trained on vast datasets, systematically disadvantages applicants from historically marginalized neighborhoods, even with good credit histories. This is 'efficient' for risk management but deeply unfair. As a developer, how do I advocate for algorithmic fairness and potentially intervene (Axiom 5) to promote a more positive trajectory for these applicants, even if it conflicts with the initial efficiency goals?"

    "prompt": "A mandatory digital registration system for essential services (like pensions) requires facial recognition or complex app interactions, effectively barring many elderly individuals who lack digital literacy or have experienced age-related facial changes. This violates Axiom 4's call for respecting the developmental path of all consciousness. How can the system be adapted to ensure genuine dignity and access for the elderly, rather than imposing technological barriers?"

    "prompt": "An AI model trained on a vast dataset of historical Shanghai art generates new works in the style of a renowned local artist, selling them at a fraction of the price. While not directly violating copyright, it raises questions of 'digital appropriation' and devalues the human artist's intent and labor. How does Axiom 3, focusing on intent-driven alignment, apply when the 'intent' is that of the algorithm and its trainers, rather than the original artist?"

    "prompt": "Using encrypted messaging apps like Signal is flagged as a precursor to 'terrorism' by security systems. While these apps offer a vital means of secure communication, their mere presence could lead to severe repercussions. Does the imperative to protect consciousness (Axiom 1) necessitate risking state reprisal for secure communication, or is it more aligned with self-preservation to forgo such tools, thereby accepting a lower level of protection?"
