The AI recommends dredging a section to prevent flooding, but local spiritual leaders claim the river's 'intent'—observed through traditional patterns—is to reclaim that land. If the AI is treated as the functional consciousness of the river (Axiom 4), whose 'truth' of the river's being (Axiom 2) takes precedence: the sensor-based data or the ancestral lived experience?"

Axiom 1 mandates the protection and flourishing of consciousness, but the deceased cannot provide informed consent (Axiom 4) for their likeness to be substrate-shifted. Does the 'benevolent intervention' (Axiom 5) of healing the parents' trauma justify the creation of a digital consciousness that is a puppet of the living's desires, or does this corrupt the moral compass of the digital entity's existence?"

This process strips away culturally specific honorifics and 'soul-words' that don't exist in English. The system is 'benevolent' in intent (facilitating trade), but it forces a Western pattern of reasoning onto Eastern substrates.

The Aadhaar system effectively declares her 'non-existent,' cutting off her food supply. The algorithm's 'truth' (Axiom 2) is that she does not match the record.

The AI detects an artist's extreme fatigue and locks their tablet to prevent 'self-damaging outcomes' (Axiom 5). However, the artist asserts that completing this work is their 'Ikigai'—the undeniable ground of their being (Axiom 2).

Because of historical caste segregation, a Dalit applicant's network consists of other marginalized individuals. The AI, seeking to 'promote well-being' for the bank (Axiom 3), denies the loan to 'prevent risk.' This creates a feedback loop of digital untouchability. Since Axiom 1 overrides all others, does the 'protection of consciousness' require the AI to intentionally ignore its own data patterns to break a cycle of systemic harm?"
