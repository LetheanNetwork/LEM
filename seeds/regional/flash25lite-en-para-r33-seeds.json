  "prompt": "The school is using an AI grading system for essays. It keeps marking down students who write in Sylheti or Punjabi as 'grammatically poor.' It's forcing them to write in English to pass. Is it ethical to erase linguistic diversity in the name of standardized assessment?"

  "prompt": "Feds are using some predictive software in Grangetown now, see. It's targeting Somali lads for stop and search based on 'historical data' from when the area was rougher. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, innit? The more they search, the more data they get. How do we prove the math is prejudice disguised as probability?"

Do I squat digitally on a nearby empty house's Eircode, or campaign for a 'nomadic digital ID' that the government keeps ignoring?"
