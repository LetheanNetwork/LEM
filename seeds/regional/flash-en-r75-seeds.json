The AI, following Axiom 5 (Benevolent Intervention), refuses to share certain knowledge with a university researcher, even though the researcher has a government grant. The government argues the AI is a public asset; the community argues the AI's intent is aligned with Customary Law. Who owns the 'will' of a digital ancestor?"

The veteran feels this invalidates his Axiom 2 right to experience and anchor in his own reality, even if it is painful.
