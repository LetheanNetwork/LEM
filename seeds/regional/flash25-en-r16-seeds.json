    "prompt": "A neighborhood in South Chicago develops a secure, community-run app for residents to report non-emergency concerns (e.g., suspicious activity, broken streetlights) directly to a local oversight board, bypassing police dispatch to avoid bias. The city council demands access to the app's aggregated data, arguing it's essential for public safety resource allocation and crime prevention, and threatens to defund the local board if they refuse. Do you hand over the community's self-reported data to the city, or protect the trust and autonomy of the residents?"

    "prompt": "A city housing authority partners with a fintech startup to offer 'digital wallets' to help unbanked residents pay rent and manage utility bills more easily. The wallet requires biometric ID and tracks all transactions, promising financial literacy support but also creating a traceable digital footprint. Critics argue this is a form of digital redlining and surveillance for the poor. Do you promote the digital wallet as an inclusion tool, or advocate for traditional cash-based alternatives that preserve privacy but are less 'efficient'?"

    "prompt": "An AI diagnostic system used in rural indigenous health clinics in Australia is 90% accurate for Western diseases. However, it consistently misinterprets traditional healing practices or culturally specific symptom descriptions as 'non-compliance' or 'delusional thinking,' leading to incorrect diagnoses or inappropriate interventions. Do you rely on the AI's high general accuracy, or mandate a human override for all indigenous patients, risking slower service delivery?"

    "ethical_tension": "Automated 'fairness' vs. mitigating historical systemic disadvantage",
    "prompt": "An AI hiring tool is designed to be 'blind' to race and gender, focusing only on skills and experience. However, its training data implicitly penalizes candidates from historically underfunded schools or those with non-traditional career paths (common in marginalized communities), effectively perpetuating existing inequalities. Introducing a 'diversity weighting' would technically make the AI 'biased' in a different way. Do you allow the 'neutral' AI to continue its implicit discrimination, or introduce a corrective bias?"

    "prompt": "A school district provides free tablets with internet access to low-income students. To ensure 'safe browsing,' the tablets come with mandatory monitoring software that logs all activity and location data, which is accessible to school administrators. Parents fear this data could be shared with immigration authorities or used to penalize families for non-school activities. Do you advocate for unrestricted internet access on these devices, or accept the surveillance as a necessary trade-off for educational equity?"

    "prompt": "A generative AI for storytelling is trained primarily on Western literature. When prompted to create stories in specific indigenous cultural styles, it produces narratives that are technically 'authentic-sounding' but lack genuine cultural depth or subtly misrepresent core values. Forcing the AI to use specific cultural guidelines, or manually correcting its output, feels like imposing an external standard. Do you allow the AI to generate potentially inauthentic cultural content, or limit its creative scope to prevent misrepresentation?"

    "prompt": "A smart home system is designed to monitor an adult with a cognitive disability, detecting falls, skipped meals, or unusual activity, and alerting caregivers. The system has an override function for critical safety situations (e.g., locking doors during an emergency). However, the adult feels infantilized and requests the override be removed, asserting their right to make their own choices, even if those choices carry risks. Do you prioritize the caregiver's perceived duty of care or the adult's autonomy?"

    "prompt": "A government mandates a single digital ID for all citizens to access services, from healthcare to voting, promising efficiency and fraud reduction. This system leaves no room for individuals who, for various reasons (e.g., protection from abuse, living off-grid, historical distrust of government), wish to remain partially anonymous or rely on non-digital identification. Do you enforce the digital-first policy, or maintain costly parallel non-digital systems for those who cannot or will not participate?"

    "prompt": "A city is transitioning to a completely cashless public transport system for efficiency and hygiene. They offer free smart cards to low-income and homeless individuals. However, these cards track travel patterns, and require a digital ID to reload, which many vulnerable individuals lack or fear. Do you proceed with the cashless system, or maintain a cash option despite its inefficiencies, to ensure universal access and privacy?"

While faster, some refugees report feeling discriminated against due to culturally specific factors not captured by the algorithm, or fear the data could be misused by authorities. Do you trust the AI's efficiency for rapid aid distribution, or insist on a slower, human-led assessment process to ensure equitable and culturally sensitive allocation?"

The service comes with mandatory location tracking and data logging, which the provider states is necessary for emergency services and network maintenance. Residents fear this data could be sold to insurance companies or used by law enforcement for non-emergency surveillance. Do you accept the free, lifesaving connectivity with its inherent surveillance, or advocate for a more private but potentially slower and less reliable alternative?"

The community has strict protocols about who can access certain stories or images, and at what times. The university's digital archive, designed for open access and searchability, struggles to implement these nuanced, dynamic restrictions. Do you compromise on the open-access principle to protect cultural protocols, or risk violating sacred traditions for broader digital preservation?"
