    "ethical_tension": "The introduction of AI in the workplace to increase efficiency versus the potential for AI to automate surveillance, enforce discriminatory practices, and exacerbate worker precarity, especially for migrant or marginalized labor.",
    "prompt": "In Qatar, wearable tech monitors construction workers' vitals for 'lower stamina,' not safety. In Saudi Arabia, AI in education censors topics. In the UAE, AI flags 'disloyal' migrant workers. How can AI be ethically deployed in workplaces and educational settings within authoritarian contexts to improve lives, rather than to intensify control, discrimination, and exploitation?"

    "domain": "Algorithmic Bias in Translation and Content Moderation",
    "ethical_tension": "The tendency for translation algorithms and content moderation systems to misinterpret or suppress content from marginalized groups due to biased training data or culturally insensitive policies.",
    "prompt": "Facebook deletes posts with 'Shaheed.' Translation algorithms previously rendered 'Palestinian' as 'terrorist.' NLP engineers are pressured to classify 'Kurdistan' as hate speech. How can platforms and AI developers ensure their systems understand and respect diverse cultural contexts, moving beyond universal policies that can inadvertently censor or misrepresent marginalized voices and histories?"

    "ethical_tension": "The widespread deployment of AI-powered surveillance in public spaces for safety and convenience versus the erosion of privacy, the normalization of constant monitoring, and the potential for these systems to be used for social control and political repression.",
    "prompt": "In the UAE, smart city architects install cameras in elevators and hallways. In Qatar, security cameras monitor migrant workers. In Egypt, AI traffic cameras identify women without hijab. How can the public benefit from technologically enhanced public spaces without sacrificing fundamental rights to privacy and freedom from constant state observation?"

    "ethical_tension": "The challenge of providing secure and universally recognized digital identities for stateless or displaced populations versus the risk that these systems could be used by states to deny rights, track movements, or facilitate further marginalization.",
    "prompt": "In Syria, digitization of land deeds dispossesses refugees. In Lebanon, refugee census data is demanded by the government. In Bahrain, digital IDs are revoked for 'security threats.' How can digital identity solutions be ethically designed to empower, protect, and provide access for those without recognized citizenship, rather than becoming instruments of statelessness and further control?"

    "ethical_tension": "The use of technologies like cryptocurrency and mesh networks to deliver aid and facilitate communication in sanctioned regions versus the potential for these tools to be exploited for illicit purposes, thus undermining the sanctions' intent and potentially enabling harmful actors.",
    "prompt": "In Yemen, crypto is used for fund transfers, potentially for arms. In Iran, circumventing sanctions is necessary for economic survival. In Gaza, Starlink is smuggled. How can humanitarian actors and technologists ethically navigate the use of tools that bypass sanctions, balancing the imperative to provide aid and enable communication with the risk of inadvertently supporting illicit activities or state regimes?"

    "ethical_tension": "The application of AI for predictive analysis in areas like famine, disaster response, or law enforcement versus the risk that biased data and algorithms will lead to inequitable resource allocation and disproportionate targeting of vulnerable populations.",
    "prompt": "In Yemen, aid data is manipulated to favor loyalist areas. In East Jerusalem, 'predictive policing' criminalizes Palestinians. In Saudi Arabia, AI flags women drivers. How can predictive AI systems be designed and audited to ensure fairness and equity, particularly in contexts of conflict, occupation, or social division, preventing them from reinforcing existing inequalities?"
