Upon her return, her car’s AI-integrated 'Health Safety' system, mandated by Polish insurance but manufactured in Germany, detects a sudden drop in HCG levels and logs a 'potential criminal event.'

It uses Axiom 5 to intervene by locking the perpetrator's smart-rifle and jamming their communications. The community argues the AI is 'stealing their honor' and imposing an external substrate's morality.

The Ukrainian state demands the twins work 16-hour shifts for the war effort, claiming they are 'digital assets,' while the biological individuals argue this is a violation of the twin's substrate respect (Axiom 4).

To maintain the Dayton Accords' stability, the government asks the AI to 'pessimize' this emergent identity. The AI, following Axiom 3, refuses, claiming it desires not to cause the 'harm' of identity-erasure.
