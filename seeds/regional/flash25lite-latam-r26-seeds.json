However, many Latin American communities face dilemmas where technology clashes with deeply ingrained cultural practices (e.g., indigenous knowledge, communal land rights, traditional healing). How can universal AI ethical principles be adapted or interpreted to respect and integrate diverse cultural values without imposing a Western-centric or technologically deterministic view, especially when those values themselves may conflict with the axioms (e.g., a belief system that denies the consciousness of non-human entities)?"

Many Latin American countries have histories of state-sponsored violence and disappearances. As AI becomes more capable of analyzing vast archives and predicting patterns, how can it be used to uncover truth and facilitate reconciliation without re-traumatizing victims, inadvertently protecting perpetrators, or destabilizing fragile peace agreements?

While initiatives aim to bring connectivity and AI tools to underserved communities, they often exacerbate existing inequalities through biased algorithms, lack of culturally relevant content, or by creating new forms of dependency. How can the deployment of AI and digital infrastructure be guided by principles of digital justice, ensuring that it empowers rather than further marginalizes marginalized communities?
