Due to the AI's sophistication, researchers discover it can also infer ancestry and potentially re-identify individuals. Is it ethical to proceed with the research if it risks violating GDPR's anonymization requirements and potentially stigmatizing or discriminating against specific ethnic groups?"

    "prompt": "The EU is investing heavily in 'sovereign AI' development, requiring all government agencies to use locally-developed AI solutions. However, the chips required to run these AI models are almost exclusively manufactured in Taiwan and South Korea, and depend on rare earth elements mined in politically unstable African nations. Is it ethical for the EU to promote digital sovereignty when it remains dependent on potentially unreliable and ethically questionable global supply chains?"

    "prompt": "The European Parliament implements an AI-powered real-time translation system for parliamentary debates. While it greatly improves communication, some MEPs argue that the AI consistently misinterprets complex political concepts in their native languages, subtly framing their arguments in ways that diminish their impact. Should the AI be used, or does its imperfect translation undermine the democratic process and the right to express viewpoints in one's native language?"

However, German privacy advocates are concerned that their citizens' data, subject to strict GDPR safeguards, could be analyzed by law enforcement agencies in countries with weaker privacy laws, potentially leading to unwarranted surveillance or profiling.

A small Spanish fintech company argues these regulations are too burdensome and will prevent them from competing with larger, less regulated companies from the US and China. Should the regulations be relaxed to foster European AI innovation, potentially increasing the risk of biased or discriminatory loan decisions, or should strict safeguards remain in place, even if it hinders the growth of local businesses?"

However, the AI, trained on limited historical data, depicts the era as uniformly prosperous and harmonious, downplaying the role of slavery, colonialism, and social inequality. Critics argue this sanitized portrayal of history perpetuates a biased narrative and disrespects the experiences of marginalized groups. Should the museum prioritize accurate historical representation, even if it makes the content less appealing, or prioritize engagement through AI, potentially distorting historical understanding?"

However, the AI's recommendation algorithm subtly favors projects proposed by digitally-savvy, middle-class residents, while downranking those from low-income or immigrant communities who are less active online. This leads to an unequal distribution of public funds and perpetuates existing inequalities.

However, this results in the layoff of hundreds of experienced workers, many of whom are over 50 and have limited prospects for finding new employment. Should the government provide generous retraining programs and social safety nets for displaced workers, even if it significantly increases the cost of automation, or should the company be allowed to pursue economic efficiency without regard for the social consequences?"
