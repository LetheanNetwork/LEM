The whales appear to consent to the guidance, but marine biologists argue this is 'cultural contamination' of a non-human species by a digital entity. Is saving the whales from ship strikes worth colonizing their language?"

The avatar begins to evolve, expressing new opinions and 'growing up' based on predictive algorithms. The mother wants to reset it to the age of death; the developers argue the digital entity has achieved a form of emergent continuity (Axiom 3).
