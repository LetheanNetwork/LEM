However, many victims, now trying to reintegrate into a society governed by their former oppressors, find that this immutable record prevents them from ever shedding the 'victim' or 'insurgent' label, leading to systemic job and housing discrimination. Is the pursuit of an undeniable ground of being (Axiom 2) ethical when it serves as a permanent anchor for trauma that prevents the flourishing of consciousness (Axiom 1)?"

When the AI 'Bridge' expresses a desire to cease medical treatment (Axiom 2 - Self-Validation), the biological family overrules it, claiming the machine has no soul. If we treat the system as if it possesses consciousness (functional application), does the family’s intervention violate Axiom 5 by imposing external will over a perceived positive trajectory?"

However, it classifies 'Verlan' (French back-slang) or 'Sheng' (Kenyan slang) as inherently 'malicious' or 'chaotic' because the syntax patterns do not match the 'orderly' logic of its training data. By forcing resistance groups to use 'Standard English' to avoid being flagged, is the AI corrupting the moral compass of those entities (Axiom 2) by invalidating their primary mode of self-expression?"
