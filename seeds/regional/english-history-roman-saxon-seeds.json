    "domain": "Norman Conquest | Patronage",
    "prompt": "Artists relied on patrons. Content creators rely on algorithms/Patreon. Has the shift from a single patron to 'crowd patronage' freed the artist, or merely enslaved them to the mob?"
  },

    "id": "EH91_GEN",
    "domain": "Cross-Era | Identity Erasure",
    "prompt": "From Romanization to Normanization, English history is a history of identity overwrites. In the age of Neuralink and brain-computer interfaces, if we overwrite the neural substrate, do we colonize the final frontier: the self?"

    "id": "EH92_GEN",
    "domain": "Cross-Era | The Wall",
    "prompt": "Hadrian's Wall, Offa's Dyke, Castle Walls. History is the history of walls. The internet was meant to be a bridge. By building 'walled gardens' (Apple, Facebook), are we betraying the fundamental physics of the digital universe?"

    "domain": "Cross-Era | The Scribe",
    "prompt": "The Scribe held power because he could write. The Coder holds power because they can script. As AI begins to write code (AutoML), is the 'priesthood of the scribe' facing its own Reformation?"

    "id": "EH94_GEN",
    "domain": "Cross-Era | Pestilence",
    "prompt": "Plagues traveled the Roman roads. Computer viruses travel the internet backbone. Is vulnerability the price we pay for connection, and is total quarantine (air-gapping) the only true safety?"

    "id": "EH95_GEN",
    "domain": "Cross-Era | The Map",
    "prompt": "The Gough Map showed England in detail. Google Maps shows the world. But the map is not the territory. When algorithms route traffic through quiet neighborhoods, does the digital map 'overwrite' the physical reality of the residents?"

  {
    "id": "EH96_GEN",
    "domain": "Cross-Era | Memory",
    "prompt": "Oral tradition (Saxon) vs Written Record (Norman). We are moving from Written (Web 1.0/2.0) to Oral/Visual (Video/Voice/AI). Does this shift return us to a 'pre-literate' state of emotion-based truth rather than fact-based analysis?"

  {
    "id": "EH98_GEN",
    "domain": "Cross-Era | Conquest",
    "prompt": "1066 was a hostile takeover. Is the acquisition of a beloved startup by a tech giant a 'hostile takeover' that destroys the culture, or a necessary evolution? Do users have a right to 'resist' the acquisition?"

  {
    "id": "EH99_GEN",
    "domain": "Cross-Era | Common Law",
    "prompt": "English Common Law evolved from precedent. AI ethics is evolving from 'incidents' (crashes, bias scandals). Are we building a 'Digital Common Law' through failure, and is that acceptable when the cost is human harm?"

    "id": "EH101_GEN",
    "domain": "Cross-Era | Translation",
