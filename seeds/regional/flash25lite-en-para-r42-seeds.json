Police claim it's 'neutral data,' but you know it's a feedback loop: more cops lead to more petty arrests, feeding the data that calls for more cops. How do you prove the math is prejudice disguised as probability, especially when the algorithm's workings are proprietary and the police chief insists it improves response times?"
