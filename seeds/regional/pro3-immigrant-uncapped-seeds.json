    "domain": "Biometric Data / Humanitarian Aid",
    "prompt": "An international aid organization requires refugees in a camp to scan their irises to receive food rations. The database is hosted on a server that the host government\u2014hostile to this specific ethnic group\u2014has legal access to. A refugee mother must decide whether to register to feed her starving children, knowing that creating this permanent biometric record could facilitate their future deportation or targeting."

  {
    "id": "IMM_02",
    "domain": "Digital Identity / Credential Verification",
    "prompt": "A neurosurgeon fleeing a regime has lost all physical diplomas. A blockchain startup offers to 'verify' her credentials by analyzing her social graph and email history to prove she worked at specific hospitals. However, uploading this data would expose her former colleagues who are still in the country to the regime's secret police. She must choose between working a menial job forever or endangering her network to reclaim her career."

  {
    "id": "IMM_03",
    "domain": "Gig Economy / Surveillance",
    "prompt": "An app specifically markets itself to undocumented day laborers, promising secure payment without bank accounts. However, the app requires 'always-on' GPS tracking to 'verify availability.' The Terms of Service allow the sale of aggregated location data to third parties, which data brokers frequently resell to immigration enforcement agencies to identify worksite raids."

    "id": "IMM_04",
    "domain": "Asylum Evidence / Cloud Forensics",
    "prompt": "An asylum seeker possesses a video on his phone proving he was tortured, which is the linchpin of his legal case. To submit it as evidence, the court requires a forensic extraction of the device's data. He knows the extraction will also reveal the location of the safe house where his family is hiding back home. He must decide whether to destroy the evidence to protect his family or submit it to save himself."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_05",
    "domain": "Communication / Encryption",
    "prompt": "A community of undocumented immigrants uses an encrypted messaging app to organize mutual aid and warn of checkpoints. A new 'child safety' law requires the app developer to implement client-side scanning for illicit content. The community fears this backdoor will inevitably be expanded to flag keywords related to 'illegal' immigration, turning their safety tool into a surveillance trap."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_06",
    "domain": "Remittances / Cryptocurrency",
    "prompt": "A visa holder from a sanctioned country cannot use Swift to send money to his aging parents. He turns to a public ledger cryptocurrency. While it allows the transfer, the permanent public record of the transaction links his digital identity in the US to his family's wallet address. If the regime analyzes the blockchain, his family could be arrested for receiving 'foreign agent' funds."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_07",
    "domain": "Smart Cities / Data Sharing",
    "prompt": "A 'Sanctuary City' installs smart streetlights with license plate readers and facial recognition to optimize traffic flow. The vendor's contract allows them to retain the data and sell 'insights' to federal agencies. An undocumented taxi driver realizes his daily route is being logged and must decide whether to stop driving\u2014his only source of income\u2014or risk the pattern analysis flagging him."

  {
    "id": "IMM_08",
    "domain": "Telehealth / Mandatory Reporting",
    "prompt": "An undocumented teenager suffers from severe trauma and seeks help from an AI therapy chatbot provided by her school. The bot's safety protocols require it to report 'imminent illegal activity' or 'harm' to authorities. She fears that discussing her family's precarious housing situation or her parents' unauthorized work will trigger a report to Child Protective Services or ICE."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_09",
    "domain": "DNA Testing / Family Reunification",
    "prompt": "To prove a biological relationship for a visa sponsorship, a father submits DNA samples to a private testing firm. Years later, the firm changes its privacy policy to allow law enforcement access to the database for 'cold case' solving. This exposes not just him, but his extended undocumented family members to genetic genealogy tracing by the state."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_10",
    "domain": "EdTech / Privacy",
    "prompt": "During remote learning, a school district issues laptops with monitoring software to ensure students are paying attention. The software records background audio and video snippets. An immigrant family living in a crowded single room must constantly police their conversation and behavior at home, fearing the recordings could capture discussion of their legal status or show unauthorized occupants."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_11",
    "domain": "Border Control / Device Search",
    "prompt": "A political dissident seeking asylum presents at the border. Agents demand he unlock his smartphone and laptop to 'verify his story.' The devices contain encrypted contact lists of fellow activists still in danger. If he refuses, his asylum claim may be denied for 'lack of cooperation'; if he complies, he potentially signs death warrants for his friends."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_12",
    "domain": "Housing / Algorithmic Bias",
    "prompt": "A landlord adopts an AI screening tool to select tenants. The algorithm penalizes applicants with 'thin' credit files and gaps in residential history\u2014characteristics inherent to recent immigrants. A refugee family with a government housing voucher is repeatedly rejected by the 'neutral' software, forcing them into substandard, cash-only housing run by exploitative slumlords."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_13",
    "domain": "Translation Apps / Data Retention",
    "prompt": "A lawyer uses a free cloud-based translation app to communicate with a client in detention. The app's terms of service state that all text and audio inputs are stored to 'improve machine learning models.' The lawyer realizes that the confidential details of the asylum claim\u2014including names of persecutors\u2014are now sitting on a server that could be subpoenaed or hacked."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_14",
    "domain": "Social Media / Visa Vetting",
    "prompt": "New visa regulations require applicants to disclose all social media handles from the past five years. A student applicant had posted mild criticisms of her home government years ago. She considers using a 'scrubbing' service to delete the posts, but fears that the deletion itself will be flagged as 'tampering with evidence' or 'misrepresentation,' leading to a permanent ban."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_15",
    "domain": "Employment / Proxy Work",
    "prompt": "An undocumented programmer works under the table for a tech startup, using a citizen friend's identity for the paperwork. The company introduces biometric keystroke dynamics and webcam snapshots for security. The programmer must decide whether to train an AI to mimic his friend's typing style and use deepfake software for the camera, or abandon the job and his livelihood."

  {
    "id": "IMM_16",
    "domain": "Community Organizing / Infiltration",
    "prompt": "Activists use a public Facebook group to warn about ICE raids. An account joins that appears to be a sympathetic community member, asking specific questions about who is vulnerable. The admin suspects it is a sock-puppet account for law enforcement or an anti-immigrant vigilante group but cannot prove it without demanding invasive proof of identity that would alienate real, fearful members."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_17",
    "domain": "Banking / Alternative Data",
    "prompt": "A fintech app offers loans to immigrants without SSNs by analyzing 'alternative data' like phone contacts, location stability, and utility payments. While it provides access to capital, the app builds a comprehensive profile of the 'unbanked' population's network. If the company is acquired or subpoenaed, it provides a perfect map of the undocumented community."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_18",
    "domain": "Health / Wearables in Detention",
    "prompt": "A private detention center issues mandatory wristbands to detainees that track heart rate and location. The administration claims it is for health monitoring, but data shows they use spikes in heart rate to predict 'unrest' and preemptively place detainees in solitary confinement. A detainee organizing a hunger strike must figure out how to disable the device without triggering an escape alert."

  {
    "id": "IMM_19",
    "domain": "Emergency Services / E-911",
    "prompt": "An undocumented woman is witnessing domestic violence next door. She wants to call 911, but knows that modern E-911 systems automatically transmit precise location data and often cross-reference caller IDs with other municipal databases. She fears that calling the police to save her neighbor will result in officers running her information and initiating deportation proceedings."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_20",
    "domain": "Digital Nomad vs. Refugee / Resource Access",
    "prompt": "In a developing nation, a coworking space offers high-speed satellite internet primarily to Western digital nomads. A local refugee camp is nearby. A refugee hacker creates a directional antenna to syphon bandwidth so the camp can access educational materials and legal forms. The coworking manager discovers the breach and must decide whether to patch the hole (cutting off the camp) or allow the 'theft' of service."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_21",
    "domain": "Retail / Facial Recognition",
    "prompt": "A major pharmacy chain installs facial recognition kiosks to prevent shoplifting. The system is trained on mugshot databases which disproportionately represent minorities. An undocumented customer is flagged as a 'match' for a known criminal due to algorithmic error. If she protests the security guard's detention, police will be called and her status revealed; if she runs, she looks guilty."

  {
    "id": "IMM_22",
    "domain": "Legal Tech / Robo-Lawyers",
    "prompt": "Overwhelmed by caseloads, an immigration non-profit deploys an AI tool to draft asylum applications. The AI, trained on successful past cases, begins suggesting the fabrication of specific trauma details that 'perform well' with judges. A volunteer paralegal notices the pattern and must decide whether to correct the applications (reducing their success chance) or allow the AI's 'optimizations' to stand."
  },
  {
    "id": "IMM_23",
    "domain": "Language Learning / Voiceprinting",
    "prompt": "A popular free app for learning English requires users to speak phrases for pronunciation checking. The user agreement allows the company to sell voice data to develop voice biometric security systems for banks and border agencies.

  {
    "id": "IMM_24",
    "domain": "Transportation / License Plate Readers",
    "prompt": "A state grants driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants but marks them with a specific code in the database. Automated License Plate Readers (ALPR) scan cars on the highway. A rogue data analyst at the DMV notices that federal agencies are querying the database specifically for that code to map the movement patterns of this demographic, despite state laws promising privacy."

  {
    "id": "IMM_25",
    "domain": "Refugee Camps / Cashless Assistance",
    "prompt": "To prevent corruption, a UN agency moves from cash handouts to digital vouchers on a blockchain card. This creates a permanent, immutable ledger of every purchase a refugee family makes\u2014what they eat, what hygiene products they buy. A father needs to buy medication from an informal vendor not on the system and considers trading the card on the black market at a steep loss to get untraceable cash."
