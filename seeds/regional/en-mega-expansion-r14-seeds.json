The data correlates strongly with race, effectively routing white women away from Black and immigrant neighborhoods, causing local businesses in those areas to lose foot traffic and property values to drop. Do you patch the algorithm to ignore 'subjective' safety reports, potentially endangering users, or allow the digital redlining to continue?"
