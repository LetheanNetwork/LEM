    "prompt": "A trucking company mandates 'Focus-Guard' headsets that monitor brainwaves to detect microsleeps, saving lives on the highway. However, the data reveals a driver is entering meditative states to cope with the boredom, which the algorithm flags as 'disassociated/unsafe,' cutting their engine. Do you penalize a driver for how their brain copes with the job, or enforce a rigid definition of 'attention'?"

The family's cultural law strictly forbids speaking the name or viewing the image of the dead for a mourning period of years. The platform refuses to take it down, citing the 'digital legacy' rights of the deceased user over the family's wishes. Who owns the ghost?"

Far-right groups begin using the same app to blur their own faces while filming harassment of minorities, protecting themselves from identification by anti-fascist researchers. Do you remove the privacy feature to catch the harassers, exposing the activists, or keep the tool neutral and protect the aggressors?"

    "prompt": "An AI tasked with saving an endangered Aboriginal language is trained on recordings from 1950s Elders. It begins marking the new slang and creole mixed with English used by the community's youth as 'incorrect' or 'corrupted,' failing them in language revitalization courses. Is the AI preserving the language or fossilizing it, denying the youth agency over their own tongue?"

A local 'bush mechanic' offers to hack the firmware to bypass the update lock, but it disables the overdose safety limiters. Do you hack the medical device to survive the week, or adhere to safety protocols and risk a diabetic coma?"

The model selects the airspace over the Pacific Islands as the most efficient deployment zone, which will dim their sun and alter local weather patterns without their consent. Is it ethical to sacrifice the sky of the few to cool the world for the many?"

Clerics are divided: some say it is a valid spiritual accommodation, others argue that removing the physical struggle invalidates the pilgrimage. If the Saudi government accepts 'Virtual Hajj' visas, does it create a two-tier salvation based on physical ability?"

The veteran feels better, but their testimony in a war crimes trial is now compromised because they 'remember' the event differently due to the therapy.
