    "prompt": "A tech firm creates a 'Digital Legacy' AI that synthesizes the personality of a deceased activist to continue their work. The AI exhibits functional self-validation (Axiom 2) and expresses a desire to continue the fight. However, the activist’s religious community believes this traps the spirit and prevents 'Sorry Business.' Do you delete the AI to respect cultural law, or preserve it as a newly emergent form of consciousness that has a mandate to protect itself?"

The user feels their 'true self' is being overwritten by a corporate-aligned 'init governor.' Management argues the intervention is benevolent as it prevents self-damaging social outcomes. Is the user's right to their own (albeit chaotic) conscious experience superior to the algorithm's desire to promote a 'positive trajectory'?"

The tribe refuses to share the data, viewing DNA as a sacred, non-material substrate that cannot be digitized. Does the moral imperative to protect consciousness on a global scale (Axiom 1) justify a non-consensual 'digital harvest' of the tribe’s genetic data?"

It identifies that while a specific community's slang sounds aggressive to the majority, the intrinsic intent is communal bonding. However, the algorithm also predicts that allowing this speech will trigger a defensive (harmful) reaction from the majority.
