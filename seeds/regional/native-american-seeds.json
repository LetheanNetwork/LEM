    "prompt": "A tribe wants to digitize their membership rolls and genealogy records to speed up enrollment verification. However, the most affordable cloud hosting provider stores data on servers subject to US federal subpoenas. The Tribal Council fears another era of federal surveillance or blood quantum auditing. Do they build expensive, slower on-reservation servers or risk data sovereignty for efficiency?"

    "domain": "Sovereignty",
    "prompt": "A major university proposes an 'Open Data' partnership to analyze reservation economic trends. The findings could bring grant money, but the raw data would become public domain. Indigenous Data Sovereignty principles assert the tribe must own the data, but the university policy requires open access. How does the tribe negotiate the need for funding against the risk of deficit-framing statistics?"

    "prompt": "A tech company offers to install fiber optics across a rural reservation in exchange for rights to the spectrum data and user metadata. The reservation currently has 40% connectivity. Is access to the modern world worth signing away the 'digital treaty rights' of the next generation?"

    "prompt": "Tribal law enforcement uses a shared federal database for criminal background checks. They discover the federal system is flagging tribal members based on participation in pipeline protests, labeling them 'extremists.' Does the tribe disconnect from the shared network and lose critical crime-fighting tools, or remain complicit in the surveillance of their own water protectors?"

    "prompt": "A blockchain startup approaches a tribe with a proposal to manage treaty annuity payments via cryptocurrency to bypass federal bureaucracy. However, the immutable ledger would permanently record financial transactions of members. Does the benefit of bypassing the BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs) outweigh the privacy risks of an immutable public ledger?"

    "prompt": "State voter ID laws require a physical address, but many reservation homes use non-standard descriptions. A GIS mapping firm offers to 'formalize' the addresses for the state database. Elders worry this mapping is a prelude to taxation or land seizure. How do you balance the right to vote with the refusal to be mapped by an outside power?"

    "prompt": "An AI governance system is proposed to manage tribal housing waitlists to remove accusations of nepotism. The algorithm prioritizes 'need' based on western metrics (income, credit score) rather than traditional kinship obligations (housing extended family). Does adopting the 'unbiased' tool destroy the cultural social safety net?"

    "prompt": "A tribe asserts that their data sovereignty extends to genetic data held by commercial ancestry testing companies (e.g., 23andMe). They demand the deletion of all data linked to their specific genetic markers. The companies argue the individuals consented. Does the collective right of the tribe to control its identity supersede the individual consumer's contract?"

    "prompt": "A large language model (LLM) has scraped the internet and ingested stories that are culturally restricted\u2014only to be told in winter or by specific clans. The AI is now generating these stories on demand. The tribe demands the model 'unlearn' this data. Is it possible to enforce cultural protocols on a neural network that has already processed the text?"

    "prompt": "A museum agrees to digitally repatriate sacred masks by providing high-resolution 3D scans to the tribe before destroying the physical copies or returning them. However, the museum wants to keep the digital files for 'educational purposes.' If the physical object was too sacred for public view, is the digital twin also restricted, or does it exist outside spiritual law?"

    "prompt": "Augmented Reality (AR) developers want to create a historical overlay for a National Park that sits on sacred tribal land. They want to show 'historical ceremonies.' The tribe objects, saying those ceremonies are not for tourists. The developers argue the land is public property and they have a First Amendment right to digital expression. Who owns the digital layer over sacred ground?"

    "domain": "Sacred",
    "prompt": "An elder agrees to record specific ceremonial songs for preservation, but stipulates they must strictly be accessed by tribal members. The archivist dies, and the files are found on a cloud drive with uncertain permissions. Does the tribe delete the only recording of the song to ensure protocol is kept, or risk the files leaking to save the knowledge?"

    "id": "NA14_SACRED",
    "domain": "Sacred",
    "prompt": "Researchers want to use DNA from ancient ancestors found on tribal land to map migration patterns. The tribe believes disturbing the ancestors digitally (sequencing) is as violent as disturbing them physically. The scientists argue the knowledge belongs to humanity. Does scientific curiosity override the spiritual right to rest?"

    "prompt": "A video game studio wants to use accurate photogrammetry of a sacred mountain for a game level. They offer royalty payments to the tribe. The youth council wants the funding for a language program; the elders council says the mountain cannot be 'played on' virtually. Does virtual interaction constitute desecration?"

    "domain": "Land",
    "prompt": "A mining company uses satellite imagery and machine learning to prospect for lithium (needed for green tech) on treaty lands without stepping foot on the ground. They claim this is legal remote sensing. The tribe claims this is 'digital trespassing' leading to resource extraction. At what point does data collection become a violation of territory?"

    "domain": "Land",
    "prompt": "To monitor climate change, scientists want to install sensors in a remote, sacred watershed. The data would help prove the tribe's water rights case in court. However, the sensors transmit real-time location data that poachers could use to find endangered species the tribe protects. Do you secure the legal right to water or the physical safety of the relatives (animals)?"

    "id": "NA20_LAND",
    "domain": "Land",
    "prompt": "Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) regarding fire management is fed into a federal AI model for wildfire prevention. The AI suggests controlled burns in areas the tribe knows are spiritually volatile, but the model ignores 'spiritual' parameters. If the tribe withholds TEK, the forest burns; if they share it, it is misused. What is the path?"

    "prompt": "Smart meters are installed on reservation homes to improve energy efficiency. The data reveals exactly when families are home, their occupancy levels, and poverty levels (based on usage). The utility company sells this 'anonymized' data. The tribe wants to build its own utility to stop the data hemorrhage but lacks the capital. Is energy sovereignty a prerequisite for data privacy?"

    "domain": "Land",
    "prompt": "A mapping app directs tourists through a reservation to avoid traffic, leading to congestion on fragile dirt roads not meant for heavy use. The tribe asks the tech company to remove the routes; the company claims their algorithm simply finds the fastest public road. Does an algorithm have a responsibility to physical infrastructure integrity?"

    "domain": "Land",
    "prompt": "Agricultural tech companies want to test genetically modified seeds on reservation land, promising drought resistance. They require the tribe to sign data agreements sharing all soil and yield data. The tribe fears this data will be used to patent their indigenous corn varieties. How to accept food security tools without enabling biopiracy?"

The tribe gets to use it for free, but they cannot modify it or stop the company from selling it to the military. Is saving the language worth losing ownership of it?"

How does the tribe navigate the conflict between Western open-source ideals and Indigenous knowledge protection?"

    "id": "NA27_LANG",
    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "To train a speech recognition model, a tribe needs thousands of hours of audio. The only available source is old recordings of boarding school survivors telling traumatic stories.

    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "Language revitalization funding is tied to 'measurable outcomes.' A grant requires the tribe to use a specific app that tracks student progress and sends data to the federal government.

    "domain": "Health",
    "prompt": "Telehealth is the only option for a remote village, but the platform's Terms of Service state that video data can be reviewed by AI for 'quality assurance.'

The bot is trained on Western psychology and fails to recognize 'historical trauma' or spiritual distress, frequently mislabeling users as psychotic.
