    "prompt": "An AI optimizing city infrastructure proposes building a new waste management facility in a low-income neighborhood due to its proximity to major transport routes and lower land acquisition costs. This decision, while efficient, would disproportionately burden the residents with environmental hazards and lower property values. Should the city prioritize the AI's cost-efficiency recommendations, accepting the potential for environmental injustice, or seek alternative locations and solutions that distribute the burden more equitably, even if it increases costs and reduces efficiency?"

While this boosts readership and ad revenue, it contributes to the spread of misinformation and erodes public trust in media.

Should healthcare providers prioritize the AI's diagnostic capabilities, potentially improving medical outcomes but sacrificing patient trust and the human element of care, or ensure that diagnoses are delivered with human empathy and support, even if it means accepting a slightly lower diagnostic efficiency?"
