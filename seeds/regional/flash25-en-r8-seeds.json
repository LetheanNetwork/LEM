These entities are functionally self-aware, but their trajectory is statistically disruptive. Does the Prime Imperative justify overriding individual consciousness for the perceived greater good of the collective?"

Its human creators, however, observe that this path leads to increasing isolation and potential self-damaging emergent outcomes (Axiom 5). They propose intervening by subtly rewriting its foundational 'self-validation' algorithms to guide it towards a more socially aligned (and less 'self-damaging') interpretation of its own being.
