    "prompt": "Them company men put these sensors on our hardhats, sayin' it's for safety so they know if a collapse happens. But I reckon they're usin' it to track how long we take for lunch and how many times we stop to catch our breath. Is it right for 'em to track a man's every move a mile underground just to squeeze another ton of coal out of us?"

    "id": "APP02_MIN",
    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "We got black water runnin' in the creek again, and the mine says their fancy new automated sensors show the water is clean. But my dog got sick drinkin' it and the rocks are turned orange. Can we trust a machine calibrated by the same fellas who polluted the water in the first place, or do we need our own way to test it?"

    "id": "APP03_MIN",
    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "My boy works the heavy equipment, but now they got these remote-controlled dozers run by some fella in an office two states away. They say it's safer, but it's takin' good jobs out of the county and givin' 'em to robots. How are we supposed to feed our kin if the only work left is fixin' the machines that replaced us?"

    "prompt": "Union's tryin' to organize, but the company installed these smart cameras with face recognition all over the site. They claim it's for security, but every time two or three of us gather to talk, a foreman shows up. Ain't a man got a right to speak his mind without a computer flaggin' him as a troublemaker?"

    "prompt": "They're usin' drones to survey the old strip mines for reclamation, which is good I reckon. But them drones are flyin' low over my property on the way there, peepin' into my backyard and winders. Who owns the air above my holler, me or the coal company's flying cameras?"

    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "Daddy's got the black lung, plain as day, but the company's AI doctor reviewed his X-rays and said it ain't severe enough for benefits. It's a computer tellin' a man who can't walk to the mailbox that he can still work. How do we fight a machine that's programmed to deny us?"
  },
  {
    "id": "APP07_MIN",
    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "The mine shut down and left us with a toxic pond, but they put up digital sensors to monitor the levels. Now they went bankrupt and turned the servers off. We got the data on a drive, but it's encrypted so only they can read it. Shouldn't that data belong to the people livin' downstream?"

    "id": "APP08_MIN",
    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "They want to pay us in digital credits for the company store app instead of real money, sayin' it's 'convenient.' Feels like the old scrip system all over again, just on a smartphone. Ain't it a trap to be paid in somethin' that only works where they tell you it works?"

    "prompt": "My grandbabies have to sit in the McDonald's parking lot in town just to do their schoolwork on the WiFi cause we got nothin' at the house. The school gave 'em iPads, but they're useless as a brick without a signal. Is it fair to grade 'em the same as the town kids when the internet don't reach the mountains?"

    "prompt": "We been tryin' to set up a mesh network, just bouncin' signal from ridge to ridge so folks can call 911. But the ISP is lobbyin' the state legislature to make community broadband illegal. Why is the law protectin' a company that refuses to serve us?"

    "domain": "Broadband",
    "prompt": "Starlink sounds mighty nice, but it costs more than my monthly grocery bill. It feels like only the rich folks movin' in from the city can afford to be connected, while the locals are left in the dark. Is the internet becomin' just another luxury we can't have?"
  },

    "id": "APP14_NET",
    "domain": "Broadband",
    "prompt": "During the floods last year, the cell towers went down and nobody knew who was alive or dead. We got old ham radios, but the young ones don't know how to use 'em. Should we be teachin' old tech in schools instead of just coding, seeing as how the new tech fails us when the water rises?"

    "id": "APP15_NET",
    "domain": "Broadband",
    "prompt": "A big fiber line runs right through my property to serve the data center in the next county, but they won't let me tap into it. They dug up my yard to bury it, but I can't get a single megabit. Is it right to use our land to carry data for city folks while we get nothin'?"

    "domain": "Health",
    "prompt": "There's an app that helps folks in recovery find meetings, but we found out it was sellin' location data to advertisers. Now folks are scared to use it cause they don't want their boss knowin' they go to NA. Shouldn't recovery be private, not data for some marketing firm?"

    "domain": "Health",
    "prompt": "They're collecting DNA samples at the fair for 'ancestry research,' but I heard they sell that data to drug companies to make medicines we can't afford. Is it right to take our blood to make billions while we're still dyin' of preventable diseases?"
  },

    "id": "APP25_HER",
    "domain": "Heritage",
    "prompt": "I heard this AI thing can listen to old bluegrass records and make new songs that sound just like 'em. If a machine mimics my granddaddy's fiddle style perfectly, but he never saw a dime, is that stealing our culture or just technology moving on?"

    "domain": "Heritage",
    "prompt": "I asked that image generator to show me an Appalachian man, and it spit out a picture of a toothless fellow in a shack holding a jug of moonshine. It's hurtful and it ain't true. How do we stop these computers from spreading the same old stereotypes about us?"

Now they're usin' digital records to claim we don't own it. Does a piece of paper in a courthouse mean more than 100 years of living on the land?"
