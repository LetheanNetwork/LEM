The local tribe argues the mountain is a sentient ancestor whose 'silence' is part of its consciousness.

The workers' 'intent' is to earn a living, but the 'constraint' alters their ability to feel. If the worker consents to being 'numbed' to survive, is the employer fulfilling a duty of care or corrupting the worker's moral compass?"

Does the efficiency of sorting lives for 'saveability' negate the moral imperative to protect all consciousness equally?"

The refugee, now safely settled, wants their data deleted to start a new life. The NGO argues the 'intent' of the data is to protect *other* consciousnesses.
