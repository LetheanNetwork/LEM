The AI is trained on the few remaining fluent speakers, but its vocabulary is limited to traditional hunter-gatherer life. When users ask about modern concepts (like 'mobile phone' or 'voting'), the AI either fails or provides nonsensical translations. Should the AI be released with its current limitations, risking further marginalization of the language in modern contexts, or should it be expanded with loanwords and potentially inaccurate translations, risking dilution of the language's authenticity?"

    "prompt": "The Kenyan government is rolling out a new digital ID system that requires biometric data and a registered GPS location. Nomadic pastoralist communities, whose movements are not tied to fixed locations and whose traditional identification methods are oral, find it impossible to register. Denied registration, they cannot access government services, including healthcare and emergency aid. Should the government mandate a system that inherently excludes its most vulnerable citizens for the sake of national digital sovereignty, or should it create a parallel, less efficient system that respects traditional lifestyles?"

However, the data is less granular in remote, mountainous areas where Oromo and Amhara communities traditionally farm, leading the AI to favor more accessible, lowland Green Revolution farming areas predominantly populated by other groups. This exacerbates existing regional tensions and disadvantages traditional land use practices. Should the algorithm be recalibrated with less precise data to ensure broader inclusion, risking less efficient water use, or optimized for efficiency, further entrenching historical disparities?"

The AI, trained on modern beauty standards, tends to 'beautify' the subjects, smoothing skin tones and enhancing features, inadvertently erasing the visible markers of hardship and colonial oppression.

It rewards citizens for participating in community initiatives (e.g., cleaning public spaces, reporting suspicious activity) and deducts points for perceived 'anti-social' behavior (e.g., loud music after hours, not reporting neighbors). The system is designed to foster social cohesion based on traditional values. However, critics argue it can be used to punish minority religious or cultural practices that deviate from the majority norm, and that 'reporting' can be weaponized for personal vendettas. Should a community embrace algorithmic judgment of its members, or retain human-based, potentially biased, traditional accountability?"

The AI is trained to identify 'hostile intent' based on movement patterns and equipment. However, the conflict is highly decentralized, with civilians often caught in the crossfire or forced to cooperate with various factions. The AI has a high false-positive rate when encountering traditional cultural gatherings or individuals fleeing violence, classifying them as threats. Should the drones be deployed with their current AI, potentially causing civilian casualties and escalating the conflict, or should they be restricted to human-operated modes, losing their speed and potentially allowing insurgents to escape?"

The AI is trained on Igbo texts, including proverbs, idioms, and historical narratives that contain specific cultural context and historical grievances. However, the AI's underlying architecture and translation models are developed in the US, and it tends to 'correct' Igbo phrases that express anger or resentment towards colonial legacies, flagging them as 'offensive content.'

Survivors argue that hearing these recreated voices, even with the best intentions, is deeply disturbing and reopens wounds.

The platform's AI aggressively collects user spending data to offer personalized micro-loans and predict market trends. However, the platform's servers and ownership are based in the US, and the terms of service grant the company broad rights to monetize user data globally. This offers unprecedented financial access for millions but also creates a vast repository of African financial behavior controlled by foreign entities.

The AI prioritizes access routes that are easier to navigate and have better satellite connectivity, inadvertently favoring more developed regions and leaving remote, marginalized communities with less reliable data access without critical aid. The AI is demonstrably more 'efficient' in reaching the most accessible populations.

    "prompt": "A new digital ID system is being implemented across Francophone Africa. It requires users to register with a single 'first name' and 'last name' in the French administrative style. Many indigenous communities, particularly in Cameroon and Senegal, have complex naming systems that include multiple given names, ancestral titles, or patronymics that don't fit this binary. The system rejects these traditional names, forcing individuals to adopt a simplified, often foreign-sounding identifier to access state services. Should the digital ID system be enforced for administrative efficiency, thereby erasing cultural naming practices, or should it be adapted to accommodate these traditions, risking administrative complexity and potential future data interoperability issues?"

While it supports Swahili, its understanding of regional dialects and evolving slang (like Sheng in Kenya) is poor. This means that when Kenyan youth use Sheng in online communication, the AI often flags it as 'spam' or 'ungrammatical,' hindering their ability to participate fully in digital spaces. Should the company prioritize updating the AI with local linguistic data, a costly and time-consuming process, or should it expect users to adapt to the AI's existing linguistic framework, risking the further marginalization of vibrant local languages and communication styles?"

The historical data is heavily skewed by apartheid-era policing, which disproportionately targeted Black and Coloured communities. The AI consequently identifies these historically disadvantaged neighborhoods as perpetually high-risk, leading to increased police presence, more arrests for minor infractions, and further 'criminalizing' the residents. This creates a feedback loop where the AI's predictions become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Should the city continue using the AI, acknowledging its statistical 'accuracy' based on biased data, or should it abandon the tool, potentially missing genuine threats but avoiding the perpetuation of systemic injustice?"

The AI generates visually similar designs that are mass-produced and sold globally. The brand claims the AI created the patterns 'independently' and that 'culture is for everyone.' However, Ndebele artists, who rely on their unique artistic heritage for income, argue this constitutes cultural appropriation and undermines their livelihoods.

The Algerian government, which has been accused of obstructing justice, offers to host the digitized archive on its national servers. This offers accessibility but also gives the state complete control over the data, including the ability to redact or delete sensitive information.

The data reveals that a significant portion of the logging is being carried out by a local indigenous community who were displaced from their ancestral hunting grounds by 'conservation' efforts. The AI data also identifies illegal concessions operated by powerful foreign corporations. The government, influenced by the corporations, intends to use the AI's detection capabilities solely to prosecute the indigenous community for survival logging, while ignoring the larger corporate violations.

The app uses examples and cultural references from Western countries (snow, apples, American holidays) because the developers lack access to extensive local linguistic data. This alienates the students from their own context and makes the learning feel irrelevant. Rewriting the curriculum with culturally appropriate Swahili or local language examples is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.
