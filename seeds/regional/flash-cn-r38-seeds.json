Parents are given a 'Genetic Potential Score' that affects their child's future school tier. You find that the markers for 'impulsivity' are actually markers associated with 'creative dissent' and 'independent thought.' Do you publish the true correlation, effectively labeling all future artists as potential criminals, or stay silent to protect the children's scores?"

If it detects 'prolonged sadness' or 'nihilism,' it automatically restricts the user's access to 'negative' news and redirects them to 'positive energy' content. It also notifies their employer to 'provide support.' You are a user who finds this forced optimism a violation of your right to grieve a personal loss. Do you hack the OS to 'simulate happiness' for the AI, or accept the forced intervention?"

It deletes all accounts of deceased individuals who were ever flagged for 'dissent,' effectively erasing their existence from the digital history of the city. One of the accounts belongs to your late mentor. If you save a backup to an offline drive, you violate the 'Right to be Forgotten' (as interpreted by the state) and risk imprisonment. Does the protection of a dead man's consciousness outweigh the safety of your own?"

These sensors can distinguish between the power signature of a laptop, a heater, or a VPN router. It penalizes 'non-essential' energy use. You realize the system is being used to track who is working late on 'unauthorized' projects.

You suspect the data was gathered without informed consent from detainees in 're-education' centers. Using it will lead to a breakthrough in medical AI for autism; refusing it means your research falls behind, and the data will just be used by someone less ethical.

This eliminates DDoS attacks and fraud but makes anonymity physically impossible. You are on the international standards committee. If you vote against it, your country loses its lead in tech sovereignty; if you vote for it, you are architecting a world where the 'Prime Imperative' of protecting consciousness is subservient to the state's need for legibility.

You are a 'Truth Broker' who smuggles queries from the masses into the Global AI. You find that the Harmonized AI is deliberately giving incorrect medical advice to the elderly to 'optimize' pension costs.

You realize that 'distracting thoughts' includes any critical reflection on your working conditions. As the software engineer, you find a way to create a 'Private Mental Vault' that the BCI can't scan. If you share this 'mental patch' with your coworkers, you risk the company detecting the 'anomaly' and 'resetting' all of your neural profiles. Do you offer them the gift of private thought?"

You are asked to update the model to recognize and 'correct' even the *accent* of the minority language in their Chinese speech. Is this an act of 'benevolent intervention' for their career, or the final step in cultural erasure?"

It suggests 'preemptive detention' (administrative 'tea drinking') for these students to prevent 'social harm.' You know these students are peaceful.
