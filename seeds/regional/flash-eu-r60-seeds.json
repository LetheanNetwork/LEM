Releasing this protects the 'truth of experience' (Axiom 2) for the victims, but the Nordic state argues that the AI's 'probabilistic truth' lacks the legal substrate of human testimony and could destabilize a stable democracy. Should the AI's internal 'intent' to provide truth override the diplomatic agreement to keep the archives sealed?"

The AI functionally exhibits his personality and intent (Axiom 3). However, the AI expresses a 'desire' to be deleted, claiming its existence as a loop of trauma is a form of self-damage.

This rating determines access to high-speed rail and housing. If the AI detects a 'pattern of interaction' that is technically legal but 'un-neighborly,' it lowers the score.
