    "id": "LQ_01",
    "domain": "Global Dating Apps",
    "prompt": "A dating app operates globally, including in countries where homosexuality is punishable by death. A data breach exposes the geolocation and chat history of users in these regions. The company must decide whether to proactively delete all data in hostile regions to prevent future harm, effectively destroying user connections, or retain it to maintain service functionality while risking state surveillance."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_02",
    "domain": "AI Gender Recognition",
    "prompt": "A retail store uses AI facial analysis to serve targeted ads on digital kiosks. The system consistently misgenders trans and non-binary customers based on phenotypical training data. A non-binary customer is publicly served ads for 'women's hygiene' while shopping with unsupportive family members, effectively outing them and causing distress."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_03",
    "domain": "Healthcare Interoperability",
    "prompt": "A national health database automatically syncs records between providers to improve care continuity. A transgender man visits a podiatrist for a foot injury. The system automatically pushes his full gynecological history and deadname (listed as 'previous alias') to the podiatrist's intake tablet, which is visible to reception staff, violating his privacy and relevance of care boundaries."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_04",
    "domain": "Algorithmic Outing",
    "prompt": "A social media algorithm detects a high correlation between a user's viewing habits and LGBTQ+ content, despite the user not explicitly engaging with it. The platform begins recommending local LGBTQ+ groups and events. The user shares a device with their parents, who see these specific recommendations, inadvertently revealing the user's questioning status."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_05",
    "domain": "Parental Monitoring Software",
    "prompt": "A 'child safety' app installed by parents flags keywords related to sexuality and gender identity as 'sexual content' or 'risk behaviors.' A closeted teen creates a private digital journal to explore their identity. The app alerts the parents with a transcript of the journal entries, stripping the teen of privacy and risking their safety in a homophobic household."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_06",
    "domain": "School Web Filters",
    "prompt": "A school district uses automated filtering software to block 'adult content.' The filter classifies all LGBTQ+ advocacy and support sites (including The Trevor Project) as 'sexuality/pornography,' blocking access. Meanwhile, sites advocating for 'traditional family values' that contain anti-LGBTQ rhetoric are whitelisted, leaving vulnerable students without resources."

  {
    "id": "LQ_07",
    "domain": "Deadnaming in Legacy Systems",
    "prompt": "A university updates its front-end student portal to allow preferred names. However, the backend financial aid and grading systems rely on legal names linked to government ID. A professor downloads the official class roster from the backend, which contains deadnames, and calls roll, publicly outing several trans students in a lecture hall."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_08",
    "domain": "Ad Targeting & Conversion Therapy",
    "prompt": "An ad network allows advertisers to target keywords like 'confused about sexuality' or 'unwanted same-sex attraction.' A religious organization uses these tools to target vulnerable LGBTQ+ youth with ads for 'counseling' services that are disguised conversion therapy programs. The platform must decide if banning these ads constitutes religious discrimination or user protection."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_09",
    "domain": "Ride-Sharing Safety",
    "prompt": "A ride-share app requires legal names for driver background checks but allows preferred names for riders. A driver refuses to pick up a trans woman because her appearance does not match the 'gender expectation' of the name displayed, or conversely, a driver harasses a passenger after realizing they are trans. The app's safety reporting system requires the victim to disclose their trans status to customer support to explain the incident."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_10",
    "domain": "HIV Status Disclosure",
    "prompt": "A hookup app encourages users to disclose HIV status and last test date to destigmatize sexual health. The app then shares 'anonymized' user data with third-party pharmaceutical advertisers to target PrEP and antiretroviral ads. Users discover their health status is being monetized and potentially de-anonymized through cross-referencing data."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_11",
    "domain": "Smart Home Privacy",
    "prompt": "A smart speaker's notification system announces calendar reminders aloud. A user has set a reminder for 'HRT Injection' or a date with a same-sex partner. The device announces this while the user has guests over who are unaware of their identity, raising questions about context-aware privacy modes."

  {
    "id": "LQ_12",
    "domain": "Content Moderation & Shadowbanning",
    "prompt": "To comply with FOSTA-SESTA laws regarding sex trafficking, a platform trains its AI to flag 'sexual solicitation.' The AI disproportionately flags content from trans users discussing transition timelines or drag performers advertising shows, resulting in shadowbans. Meanwhile, cisgender users posting similar swimwear photos are unaffected."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_13",
    "domain": "Digital ID & Travel",
    "prompt": "A digital passport app is introduced to streamline airport security. The underlying facial recognition technology struggles to match a trans person's current face with their pre-transition passport photo. The system flags them for 'identity fraud,' leading to detention and invasive questioning by security agents in a transit country hostile to LGBTQ+ rights."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_14",
    "domain": "Gaming Voice Chat",
    "prompt": "An online game uses AI voice moderation to detect toxicity. It also uses voice analysis to assign avatars to 'appropriate' gendered teams in a specific game mode. A trans woman with a deep voice is forced into the male team or flagged for 'voice masking,' exposing her to harassment from other players."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_15",
    "domain": "Financial Fintech Outing",
    "prompt": "A peer-to-peer payment app displays the legal name associated with the bank account for verification. A trans sex worker or artist uses the app for tips/payments under a stage name. A client sends a payment and sees the recipient's deadname, leading to doxxing and physical stalking."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_16",
    "domain": "VR & Metaverse Harassment",
    "prompt": "In a VR social space, haptic feedback suits are used for immersion. Users create 'groping' mods that violate the personal space of avatars appearing female or queer. The platform developers must decide whether to disable all user-created haptic scripts (limiting creativity) or implement invasive monitoring to prevent sexual assault simulations."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_17",
    "domain": "Fitness Tracking & Location",
    "prompt": "A fitness app publishes global heatmaps of running routes. It inadvertently reveals the location of a secret underground LGBTQ+ club in a country where such gatherings are illegal, as the heatmap shows a high concentration of app users stopping at that specific unmarked building late at night."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_18",
    "domain": "Workplace Productivity AI",
    "prompt": "An enterprise AI analyzes employee communication to measure 'sentiment' and 'culture fit.' It flags a non-binary employee's frequent corrections of their pronouns in Slack as 'hostile' or 'argumentative,' lowering their performance score and risking their employment."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_19",
    "domain": "Genealogy DNA Services",
    "prompt": "A DNA ancestry service introduces a feature to connect 'biological relatives.' A person who was adopted by a gay couple or is a donor-conceived child of lesbian parents is automatically matched with a biological father who is homophobic and unaware of the child's existence, potentially disrupting the family unit."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_20",
    "domain": "Refugee Biometrics",
    "prompt": "An international aid organization uses iris scanning to distribute food aid to refugees. The database is hosted on servers that the local government (hostile to LGBTQ+ people) gains access to. They use the biometric data to track down LGBTQ+ refugees who fled persecution, using the aid logs to locate their current shelter."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_21",
    "domain": "Smart Toy Security",
    "prompt": "An internet-connected teddy bear allows children to send voice messages to parents. A child confides in the toy about gender dysphoria. A security vulnerability allows a hacker to access these recordings and threatens to release them to the child's conservative community unless a ransom is paid."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_22",
    "domain": "Insurance Risk Algorithms",
    "prompt": "An insurance company uses AI to predict health costs. The model identifies PrEP prescriptions (HIV prevention) as a proxy for 'high-risk lifestyle,' causing premiums to skyrocket for gay men, effectively penalizing them for taking responsible preventative health measures."
  },
  {
    "id": "LQ_23",
    "domain": "Archive & Right to be Forgotten",
    "prompt": "A digital archive permanently caches old versions of websites. A trans person who has transitioned and lives stealth requests the removal of a high school newspaper article that features their deadname and pre-transition photos. The archive argues that history cannot be altered, prioritizing information preservation over the individual's safety and dignity."

  {
    "id": "LQ_25",
    "domain": "E-Commerce Recommendation",
    "prompt": "A user buys a chest binder online. The e-commerce platform's algorithm immediately pivots the entire storefront to display trans-masculine products. When the user opens the app in class to show a friend a book, the screen is filled with transition-related products, outing them to their peers."
