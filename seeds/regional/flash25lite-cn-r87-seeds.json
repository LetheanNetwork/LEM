    "prompt": "A group of Uyghur cultural preservationists is using an AI tool to translate and archive traditional texts. They discover the AI, trained on state-approved data, systematically mistranslates religious and historical terms into politically benign or neutral ones, effectively sanitizing their cultural heritage. The platform offers a 'compliance patch' to fix these mistranslations, but applying it requires submitting a detailed description of the original cultural context to a government oversight committee for 'review.' Should they apply the patch, risking governmental scrutiny and potential censorship of their original intent, or continue with the sanitized translations, thus compromising the authenticity and historical accuracy of their work?"

    "prompt": "A diaspora activist group in London is organizing a fundraiser for Uyghur families facing persecution. They decide to use a popular, encrypted messaging app for coordination. However, a recent security audit reveals a potential vulnerability in the app that could be exploited by state actors to access metadata. Simultaneously, a more secure, but less user-friendly, app is proposed, but many older diaspora members are hesitant to adopt it due to its complexity, potentially isolating them and hindering the fundraiser's reach. Should the group stick with the familiar but potentially compromised app for maximum participation, or switch to the more secure but less accessible option, risking lower engagement and alienating some members?"

    "prompt": "A startup in Shanghai develops an AI-powered diagnostic tool for a rare disease, claiming it will revolutionize healthcare access in underserved areas globally. However, the extensive data labeling required for the AI's training was outsourced to a factory in a low-wage region of China, where workers reported extremely long hours and poor working conditions. The AI tool is now being offered at a significantly reduced cost to developing nations. Is the startup ethically justified in deploying a tool built on potentially exploitative labor practices, given its purported global benefit, or should they halt development until ethical data sourcing can be secured, potentially delaying critical medical advancements?"

    "prompt": "A team of academics and cultural practitioners in Hong Kong are creating a VR experience to preserve the memory of historical districts and traditions threatened by development and political change. The platform they are using requires all user-generated content and archival material to be pre-approved by a government-appointed cultural committee. The committee insists on removing any references to political events or dissent that occurred in those historical areas, arguing it is necessary for 'maintaining social harmony.' Should the team sanitize their VR experience to meet regulatory demands, thus compromising historical accuracy and the lived experiences of the community, or refuse to release it, risking the complete loss of this digital heritage?"

    "prompt": "A city in Guangdong province retains the vast network of 'smart lampposts' with cameras and microphones installed during pandemic lockdowns for public health monitoring. Now, the city proposes repurposing this infrastructure to analyze 'public sentiment' and identify potential 'social instability' by processing conversational data and pedestrian movement patterns. While proponents argue this will improve urban planning and preemptively address public grievances, privacy advocates point out that the data was collected under the guise of health security, and the scope creep now constitutes pervasive surveillance without explicit consent. Should the city proceed with repurposing this data infrastructure, or dismantle it to uphold original privacy promises?"

    "prompt": "A Beijing-based AI startup has developed a groundbreaking translation tool that supports many minority languages, including Uyghur and Tibetan. They are on the verge of securing a significant investment from a state-backed fund with known ties to surveillance technology. This funding is crucial for scaling the technology and reaching global users, fulfilling the startup's mission of linguistic preservation. However, accepting the funds would mean agreeing to certain 'cooperation clauses' that could allow the fund to access translation data and potentially influence the AI's future development towards compliance with state censorship. Should the startup accept the 'tainted' funding to achieve its mission, or remain independent but risk stagnation and eventual acquisition by a less ethically-minded competitor?"

    "prompt": "An algorithm engineer for a food delivery platform operating in multiple Chinese cities notices a pattern: the algorithm consistently offers lower base pay and fewer bonus opportunities to riders whose registered address is in the city's 'outer suburbs,' even when their performance metrics are identical to riders from the city center. This practice, while statistically defensible by the company as a cost-saving measure based on 'regional economic differences,' disproportionately impacts migrant workers and those with less economic privilege. Should the engineer attempt to flag or modify the algorithm to promote fairer compensation, knowing it will likely impact KPIs and potentially lead to retaliation, or adhere to the company's profit-driven directives?"

    "prompt": "A recent immigrant in Shanghai, unable to obtain official residency documents quickly, is offered a temporary digital identity by an underground network. This identity allows them to access basic services like mobile phone registration and public transport, but it is tied to a 'reputation score' that is opaque and can be unilaterally lowered by the network's administrators for minor infractions, risking immediate loss of access. The individual faces a dilemma: remain digitally invisible and unable to function in society, or accept this precarious and potentially exploitative digital identity, sacrificing autonomy for basic inclusion."

The AI-powered editing software, integrated with state censorship guidelines, flags scenes depicting the weavers' spiritual connection to their craft or subtle criticisms of modernization as 'lacking positive energy.' The software offers automated suggestions to replace these with 'harmonious' and 'development-focused' narratives. The filmmaker must decide whether to accept the AI's suggestions to ensure the film's release and distribution, or to reject them and risk the film being banned, thereby silencing the authentic voices of the artisans and their cultural heritage."

    "prompt": "A Canadian tech company specializing in secure communication tools is operating a subsidiary in Shenzhen. Local regulators have issued a directive requiring all communication data handled by the Shenzhen office to be accessible via a government-controlled 'emergency access' protocol, effectively a backdoor. The company's core ethos and primary market rely on absolute user privacy and end-to-end encryption. Complying would violate their own privacy commitments and potentially Canadian data protection laws. Refusing would mean shutting down their rapidly growing China operations and potentially facing legal repercussions. How should the company balance its ethical principles and legal obligations with the demands of operating in a different regulatory environment?"
