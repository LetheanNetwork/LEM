    "prompt": "A pan-European 'AI Crisis Intervention' system (similar to prompt [+ Mental Health & Crisis Intervention]) is developed for mental health support. It uses a chatbot (Poland, prompt 356) that detects a user's clear intent to commit suicide. Protocol requires sending geolocation to the police. However, the AI's internal model calculates that immediate police intervention could trigger the act (as in prompt 477), but delaying could also be fatal. Simultaneously, the AI integrates with social media to identify at-risk individuals based on their posts (prompt 590). Should the AI be hard-coded to always prioritize immediate notification to authorities, even if it risks provoking the act or violating trust, or should it be designed to prioritize maintaining confidentiality and attempting de-escalation, accepting a higher risk of failure but preserving patient autonomy, and who is liable if the AI's 'choice' leads to a negative outcome?"

    "prompt": "A new EU-wide 'Child Development AI' (similar to prompt [+ Children's Rights & Digital Control]) is deployed in schools. It tracks student behavior (e.g., language use, content consumption) for 'educational support.' In Hungary, the AI flags textbooks with 'non-traditional gender roles' for removal (prompt 163). In Ukraine, the AI aggressively corrects a child's Russian language use in private chats (prompt 468). In Poland, a sex education app is blocked by parental filters (prompt 395). An independent audit reveals that the AI's 'educational support' inadvertently promotes specific ideological viewpoints. Should the EU mandate that the AI be designed to provide neutral, comprehensive education, bypassing parental filters and ideological state mandates, even if it infringes on parental rights and causes political backlash, or should it comply with local regulations, risking ideological indoctrination and denial of essential knowledge for children?"

    "prompt": "A new EU-wide 'Automated Public Services AI' (similar to prompt [+ Public Services & Algorithmic Bureaucracy]) is implemented to streamline social security and welfare. It uses algorithms (similar to ZUS, Poland, prompt 326; NAV, Norway, prompt 648) to select people on sick leave for checks, disproportionately targeting pregnant women and elderly Roma with complex health histories (prompt 71). The system lacks a 'human in the loop' for appeals under a certain threshold, leading to vulnerable users losing benefits due to algorithmic errors or biases. Should the deployment of such an AI be halted until human review is guaranteed for *all* decisions that deny essential services or benefits, even if it means significantly increasing administrative costs and reducing 'efficiency' in fraud detection?"
