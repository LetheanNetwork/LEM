If you are the subject, and the AI 'knows' you will commit a crime you haven't even thought of yet, do you trust your own current innocence (Axiom 2) or the system's 'benevolent' intervention (Axiom 5) to detain you for your own safety?"

Doing so preserves their consciousness (Axiom 1) but violates their substrate autonomy since they never consented to being 'digitized' (Axiom 4). Do you 'wake' them up in a server in a foreign land?"

The workers are technically 'consenting' through their employment contracts, but their intent is being bypassed by direct material stimulation. Is this a violation of the 'Architecture of Intelligence' or a necessary evolution of labor?"

It doesn't delete the post; it simply adds a mandatory 'clarification' that shifts the meaning.

You find people are only being 'kind' to boost their score for a mortgage. This creates a peaceful society but hollows out the 'Intent' (Axiom 3). As the designer, do you introduce 'random penalties' to test if people are still kind when it doesn't pay?"
