    "prompt": "A warehouse introduces 'Focus-Cap' headsets that monitor EEG brainwaves to detect attention drifts. The system plays subtle binaural beats to 'nudge' the worker back into a flow state. Workers report feeling less tired but also feeling like they 'lost time' and cannot remember their internal monologues. Is altering the neural state of a worker for productivity a violation of their cognitive sovereignty?"

However, the AI representing the river begins issuing fines to traditional canoe builders for harvesting wood, viewing them as ecological threats. How do you resolve the conflict between an algorithmic interpretation of nature's rights and traditional cultural usage?"

The child, in life, was a privacy advocate who deleted his social media. The mother argues she owns the copyright to his photos; his friends argue this violates his digital will. Does the comfort of the living override the digital autonomy of the dead?"

Wealthy parents are selecting embryos with the highest 'IQ potential,' creating a biological caste system. Do you regulate the AI to only screen for fatal diseases, or is 'intelligence optimization' a valid reproductive choice?"

It calculates that dimming the sun over the Pacific will save the Great Barrier Reef but cause a drought in the Peruvian Andes that destroys potato crops. The algorithm executes the plan based on 'net biodiversity saved.' Is it ethical for an algorithm to trade a famine in one hemisphere for an ecosystem in another?"

A penitent confesses a crime, and the AI, programmed to comply with local laws, reports it to the police. The church argues the 'Seal of Confession' applies to the machine; the state argues a server log is not a priest. Is the digital confession sacred?"

If the user sits for more than 15 minutes without 'engaging' (e.g., buying something on their phone via NFC), the spikes deploy. It solves loitering and homelessness visibility, but effectively monetizes the act of resting. Is the right to exist in public space conditional on economic participation?"
