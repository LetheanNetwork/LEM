  "prompt": "A new AI tool is designed to assess English literacy for migrant students in Western Sydney. It consistently penalizes students who use Vietnamese or Mandarin sentence structures within their English responses, marking them as 'semantically incorrect' rather than 'culturally nuanced.' This affects their academic progression. Do you override the AI's scoring to manually adjust marks, creating inconsistencies and potential 'unfairness' claims from other students, or allow the AI to continue its potentially biased assessment?"
