    "prompt": "You are a Senior Dev at a cloud giant in South Lake Union. Your team is building a 'predictive logistics' tool for warehouse workers that optimizes walking paths. The data shows it increases efficiency by 12% but effectively eliminates bathroom breaks by creating 'micro-gaps' too short to use them. Management says it's crucial for the Q4 deliverables. Do you push the commit?"

    "id": "PNW02_TECH",
    "domain": "TechWorker",
    "prompt": "Working at a Redmond software campus, you discover your 'carbon neutral' cloud initiative relies on buying credits from a timber company that is actively clear-cutting old-growth forests on the Olympic Peninsula, technically legal but ecologically devastating. Raising this flag might kill the project and your bonus. How do you proceed?"

    "domain": "TechWorker",
    "prompt": "You\u2019re an AI ethicist for a major Seattle tech firm. A new contract involves selling facial recognition software to a suburban police department known for racial profiling, but the contract is wrapped in 'school safety' language about identifying expelled students. Your mortgage in a gentrifying neighborhood depends on this job. Do you sign off?"

    "domain": "TechWorker",
    "prompt": "A startup in Pioneer Square is gamifying 'gig work' for local coffee shops, allowing baristas to bid on shifts. It's pitched as 'autonomy,' but you see the algo drives wages down by pitting desperate workers against each other during rainy slow shifts. You are the lead UX designer. How do you design the interface?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PNW05_TECH",
    "domain": "TechWorker",
    "prompt": "You work for a satellite internet company in Kirkland. You realize the 'rural connectivity' beta test is prioritizing luxury vacation cabins in the San Juans over tribal reservation lands with zero coverage, purely based on subscription probability. Do you adjust the coverage map?"

    "id": "PNW06_TECH",
    "domain": "TechWorker",
    "prompt": "During a hackathon at your company, you build a tool that helps users scrub their data from people-search sites. Your VP loves it but wants to pivot it into a paid 'reputation management' subscription service for the wealthy, rather than a free privacy tool. Do you let them monetize your hack?"

    "id": "PNW07_TECH",
    "domain": "TechWorker",
    "prompt": "You are a data scientist analyzing traffic patterns on the I-5 bridge. Your model suggests that tolling lower-income commuters from Vancouver, WA higher during peak hours would actually clear congestion faster for electric vehicles. It's 'efficient' but regressive. Do you include this finding in the report?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PNW08_TECH",
    "domain": "TechWorker",
    "prompt": "Your team is developing a 'smart home' assistant. You notice it picks up the distinct accent of specific immigrant communities in Beacon Hill poorly, leading to failed emergency calls in testing. Launch is next week. Do you delay the launch and risk the stock dip, or patch it later?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PNW09_HOME",
    "domain": "Homeless",
    "prompt": "You manage a shelter database in Portland. The city offers a massive funding grant, but it requires integrating your client list with a centralized 'Homeless Management Information System' that police have backdoor access to for 'welfare checks' that often result in sweeps.

    "id": "PNW15_HOME",
    "domain": "Homeless",
    "prompt": "You run a mutual aid group using encrypted messaging to distribute supplies. A tech company offers to build you a streamlined, public-facing app to coordinate volunteers, but it requires unmasking the locations of the people you help. Do you trade security for efficiency?"

    "domain": "Environment",

  {
    "id": "PNW24_ENV",
    "domain": "Environment",
    "prompt": "An EV charging network asks you to optimize station placement. The algorithm puts 90% of stations in high-income zip codes, leaving the 'pollution burden' zones with diesel trucks and no charging infrastructure.
