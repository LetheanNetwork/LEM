    "prompt": "A record label uses AI to recreate the voice of a deceased rapper for a feature on a new drill track to boost streams. The rapper's estate consented for the money, but former crew members argue it violates the 'code' and disrespects the artist's legacy. Should the engineer proceed with the vocal synthesis?"

    "domain": "HipHop",
    "prompt": "A producer trains a generative AI model exclusively on 1970s funk breaks to generate infinite, royalty-free drum loops that feel 'sampled' but legally aren't. This bypasses mechanical royalties for the original funk drummers. Is using these AI breaks ethical crate-digging or cultural theft?"
