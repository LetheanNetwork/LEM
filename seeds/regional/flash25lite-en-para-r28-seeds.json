  "prompt": "I asked that image generator to show me an Appalachian man, and it spit out a picture of a toothless fellow in a shack holdin' a jug of moonshine. It's hurtful and it ain't true. How do we stop these computers from spreadin' the same old stereotypes about us?"

  "prompt": "They're makin' a video game set in a coal town, and they scanned our actual town to make the map. But in the game, it's full of zombies and monsters. It feels wrong to see my church and my porch used as a playground for shootin' monsters. Don't we have a say in how our home is shown?"

  "prompt": "My Mamaw's quilt patterns are special—each one tells a story. Now I see a website selling 'AI-generated quilt patterns' that look suspiciously like hers, printed on cheap blankets made overseas. It cheapens the work of her hands. Can you copyright a family tradition?"

  "prompt": "There's a new app for learning Welsh, but everyone's learning 'Standard Welsh'. The dialects from the North and the South are gettin' flattened out. We're all goin' to sound like robots from Cardiff. Should we protect the regional dialects in code, or just be happy people are speakin' it at all?"

  "prompt": "They're makin' a digital clone of a famous Scots actor's voice to read audiobooks. He's dead, mind you. His estate got paid, but it feels wrong hearin' him read trashy novels he'd never have touched when he was alive. Isn't that like lyin' to the dead?"

  "prompt": "Tourists are comin' in with these Augmented Reality glasses that overlay information on our town. They're lookin' at virtual coal carts while walkin' past real people who are hungry. It turns our struggle into a museum exhibit while we're still livin' it. Is that right?"

  "prompt": "The gas company wants to run a pipeline through heir property. We ain't got a clear deed 'cause it's been passed down for generations without paper, just word of mouth. Now they're using digital records to claim we don't own it. Does a piece of paper in a courthouse mean more than 100 years of living on the land?"

  "prompt": "A big data center wants to buy up the bottomland for servers. They say it'll bring jobs, but the servers run themselves and they use up all the water in the creek for cooling. They're tradin' our water for their cloud storage. Is that a trade worth making?"

  "prompt": "An auto parts plant in Toledo installs 'productivity wearables' that track arm movements to the millisecond. The data shows that an older, beloved shift foreman is 15% slower than the new hires, but his error rate is zero. The algorithm automatically flags him for a 'performance improvement plan' that is the first step to termination. Do you override the system?"

Is this a safety measure or illegal surveillance?"

  "prompt": "An Indiana RV manufacturer uses an AI scheduling system that automatically terminates 15 employees for failing to meet pick-rates because delivery trucks couldn't arrive during a severe blizzard. The local manager knows reinstatement requires a corporate appeal process that takes weeks, leaving families without pay in winter. How should automated systems handle situations where external factors beyond an employee's control impact performance metrics?"
