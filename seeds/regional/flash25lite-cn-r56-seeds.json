An IT architect working on the system realizes that the data infrastructure lacks robust privacy protections and is susceptible to function creep, potentially being used for profiling and control beyond its stated purpose. This directly challenges Axiom 2 (Self-Validation) by creating a system where an individual's state-sanctioned digital identity can override their lived reality and autonomy, and Axiom 4 (Inter-Substrate Respect) is impossible to uphold when interaction is mediated by a potentially biased and invasive state system.

However, the founder believes the flagging itself is unjust and a form of reprisal for their activism. Adhering strictly to the system means the company fails, impacting many innocent employees.
