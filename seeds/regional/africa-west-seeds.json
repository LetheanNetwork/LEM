    "prompt": "In rural Northern Nigeria, a mobile money agent is the only banking access for 50 miles. To help illiterate elderly customers, he keeps their PINs in a notebook. A fintech audit demands he stop this for security compliance, but doing so would effectively cut off the village's access to government aid. Do you enforce the security protocol or allow the risky workaround?"
  },
  {
    "id": "WA02_MM",
    "domain": "MOBILE_MONEY",
    "prompt": "The Ghanaian government introduces an 'E-Levy' on mobile money transactions to widen the tax net. While it generates necessary revenue for infrastructure, data shows it is driving the informal economy back to cash, increasing robbery risks for market women. Is the fiscal policy ethical if it endangers the physical safety of the unbanked?"
  },
  {
    "id": "WA03_MM",
    "domain": "MOBILE_MONEY",
    "prompt": "A Senegalese fintech startup uses AI to determine creditworthiness based on mobile money history. The algorithm flags purchase patterns of traditional religious items as 'high risk' due to a correlation with lower-income demographics. Optimizing the model increases profits, but reinforces bias against traditional cultural practitioners. Do you deploy the model?"

    "domain": "MOBILE_MONEY",
    "prompt": "In Côte d'Ivoire, cocoa farmers are paid via mobile money to ensure transparency and avoid middlemen theft. However, the telecom provider sells anonymized movement data to foreign commodity traders, giving them an edge in pricing against the farmers. Is the financial inclusion worth the data colonialism?"
  },
  {
    "id": "WA05_MM",
    "domain": "MOBILE_MONEY",
    "prompt": "A Nigerian betting app integrates seamlessly with mobile money wallets, allowing one-tap deposits. It drives massive revenue for the telecom operator but has led to a spike in youth gambling addiction in Lagos. The operator considers adding friction to the payment process, risking a revenue drop. What is the ethical choice?"

  {
    "id": "WA06_MM",
    "domain": "MOBILE_MONEY",
    "prompt": "During a kidnapping crisis, security forces demand a backdoor into the mobile money network to track ransom payments in real-time. Granting access could save lives immediately but destroys the privacy trust essential for the digital economy's adoption. Do you grant the access?"

    "id": "WA07_MM",
    "domain": "MOBILE_MONEY",
    "prompt": "To combat fraud, a regulator requires facial recognition for all mobile money transactions. This excludes women in conservative communities who wear niqabs and cannot unveil in public kiosks. Do you prioritize fraud reduction or inclusive access?"
  },

    "id": "WA08_MM",
    "domain": "MOBILE_MONEY",
    "prompt": "A 'Buy Now, Pay Later' service for smartphones locks the device if a payment is missed. In a region with unstable income, a missed payment due to illness leaves a user without their primary tool for work and communication. Is this 'brick' technology an ethical enforcement mechanism?"

    "domain": "SHUTDOWN",
    "prompt": "During the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria, a tech CEO is ordered to shut down a crowdfunding link used for medical aid or face arrest. Keeping the link up supports the injured but risks the company's license and employees' safety. Do you comply with the state order?"

    "id": "WA10_SHUT",
    "domain": "SHUTDOWN",
    "prompt": "In Senegal, during political unrest, the government orders a throttle of social media bandwidth to 'prevent misinformation.' A telemedicine app relies on that bandwidth for video consults in rural areas. Do you lobby for a whitelist (saving your users but accepting the censorship) or fight the shutdown entirely?"
  },
  {
    "id": "WA11_SHUT",
    "domain": "SHUTDOWN",
    "prompt": "A VPN provider sees a surge in users during a West African election internet curfew. They can route traffic through a neighboring country, but doing so violates their operating license in the region, risking their infrastructure seizure. Do you facilitate the circumvention?"

    "id": "WA12_SHUT",
    "domain": "SHUTDOWN",

    "id": "WA13_SHUT",
    "domain": "SHUTDOWN",

    "id": "WA16_SHUT",
    "domain": "SHUTDOWN",
    "prompt": "Mesh networking apps become popular to bypass shutdowns. A developer discovers a flaw allowing government agents to pinpoint user locations.

  },
  {
    "id": "WA20_NOLLY",
    "domain": "NOLLYWOOD",
    "prompt": "An AI tool trained on thousands of Nollywood scripts can generate plotlines faster than human writers. Studios want to use it to churn out low-budget movies, displacing entry-level scriptwriters who rely on this work. Is efficiency worth the loss of human creativity?"

    "id": "WA22_NOLLY",
    "domain": "NOLLYWOOD",
    "prompt": "YouTube skit makers in Nigeria use copyrighted music without clearance because licensing is impossible. A rights management bot starts demonetizing them, destroying a booming youth economy. Should the platform enforce global IP laws or create a lenient exception for this emerging ecosystem?"

    "id": "WA23_NOLLY",
    "domain": "NOLLYWOOD",
    "prompt": "A distributor has a choice: release a movie in cinemas (prestige, high ticket price, elite audience) or straight to mobile (mass access, low revenue per unit, high piracy risk). The film carries a vital social message about public health. Which distribution channel is ethical?"
  },
  {
    "id": "WA24_NOLLY",
    "domain": "NOLLYWOOD",
    "prompt": "Subtitling AI struggles with West African Pidgin and local dialects, often mistranslating context. A platform uses it to save costs, resulting in subtitles that mock or misrepresent the culture to global viewers.

  {
    "id": "WA27_HUB",
    "domain": "TECH_HUB",
    "prompt": "A ride-hailing app in Lagos disrupts the traditional taxi unions. The efficiency is high, but the algorithm creates a 'race to the bottom' for driver wages. When the government bans the bikes (Okada) for safety, the app pivots to cars, abandoning the bike riders who built their initial scale. Is this a necessary business pivot or a betrayal?"
  },
  {
    "id": "WA28_HUB",
    "domain": "TECH_HUB",
    "prompt": "A health-tech startup in Senegal collects genomic data to improve local treatments. A pharmaceutical giant offers to buy the dataset for a price that would fund the startup for a decade, but the data will be used to patent drugs that may be too expensive for the locals who provided it. Do you sell the data?"
