    "prompt": "A secure, anonymous platform is created to allow citizens within a highly controlled regime to leak evidence of corruption and human rights violations. However, it becomes apparent that state intelligence agencies are also using the platform, either by planting disinformation, identifying users through sophisticated means, or by leveraging the leaks themselves to target opposition figures. The platform administrators must decide how to maintain security and integrity while also preventing it from becoming a tool for the very entities it aims to expose."

    "prompt": "Following a period of intense conflict, an initiative seeks to create a digital archive of testimonies, images, and videos documenting the experiences of victims. While intended for remembrance and accountability, the raw, unfiltered nature of the content risks re-traumatizing survivors and can be exploited by different factions to fuel ongoing grievances and hatred. Furthermore, the accessibility of such sensitive material raises questions about consent and privacy. What are the ethical guidelines for collecting, storing, and sharing digital records of collective trauma?"

    "ethical_tension": "The tendency to believe that technological innovation can solve deeply rooted social, political, or economic problems, often overlooking the importance of human agency, political will, and addressing systemic inequalities, leading to superficial or even harmful implementations.",
    "prompt": "In a region grappling with widespread poverty and lack of opportunity, a tech company proposes a 'universal basic digital income' funded by targeted advertising and data monetization. They claim this will alleviate poverty through AI-driven personalized micro-entrepreneurship opportunities. However, critics argue this approach distracts from the need for systemic economic reform, job creation, and fair labor practices, and that it merely commodifies the data of the poor without addressing the root causes of their hardship. Is 'tech solutionism' an ethical approach when faced with complex human issues, or does it risk creating new forms of digital dependency and exploitation?"
