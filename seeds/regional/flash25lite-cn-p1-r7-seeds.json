  "prompt": "A university is implementing an AI-powered learning platform that adapts curriculum and provides automated feedback. You discover that the AI, trained on state-approved historical and political texts, subtly steers students away from critical analysis of sensitive topics and rewards conformity to official narratives. This undermines the pursuit of truth and critical thinking, essential for intellectual development. Your department head praises the AI's efficiency and its alignment with national educational goals.
