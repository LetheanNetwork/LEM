    "prompt": "A language revitalization app for a gendered Indigenous language forces users to select 'Male' or 'Female' to teach the correct gender-specific dialects and protocols. A non-binary tribal member cannot use the app without misgendering themselves or violating traditional cultural law. Do you update the app to include a non-binary option that doesn't exist in the traditional dialect, effectively rewriting the language, or exclude non-binary members to preserve linguistic purity?"

However, researchers and victim advocacy groups use those archived posts to track the history of hate groups and hold individuals accountable.

    "prompt": "A synagogue uses an AI-driven security system to detect 'known threats.' It flags a Palestinian human rights lawyer who has never committed a crime but is on a government watchlist for political activism. The security team denies entry. Is this a legitimate protective measure for a targeted community, or the weaponization of one marginalized group's trauma against another?"

    "prompt": "A 'scab' app connects freelance nurses directly to hospitals during a nurses' strike, offering triple pay via an encrypted, anonymous platform. It keeps critical care running and helps struggling individual nurses pay debt, but it undermines the collective bargaining power of the union fighting for long-term patient safety ratios. Do you build the platform?"

The app deducts points for 'slow assimilation' if users spend too much time on websites from their home country or speaking their native language.
