    "prompt": "Look mate, the government reckons this new satellite internet is the ducks nuts for the bush, but it costs an arm and a leg. My neighbour's kids can't do their schoolwork because they can't afford the connection fees. Is it fair dinkum to make education reliant on tech that half the station owners can't access?"

    "domain": "Outback",
    "prompt": "I bought this massive yank tank tractor, top of the line, right? But the software's locked down tighter than a fish's backside. If a sensor busts in the middle of harvest, I can't fix it with a spanner; I gotta fly a bloke out from Sydney. I own the metal, but do I own the machine if I can't repair it?"
  },

    "id": "AU03_OUTBACK",
    "domain": "Outback",
    "prompt": "These ag-tech mobs are putting sensors all over my paddocks to monitor soil moisture. Helpful, yeah, but then they aggregate that data and sell the yield predictions to the futures market before I've even harvested. Seems a bit rich that they're making cash off my dirt while I'm taking all the risk."

    "domain": "Outback",
    "prompt": "We've got drones checking the fences now, saves riding the boundary for days. But the footage captures the neighbour's missus sunbaking in her backyard. The law says the airspace is clear, but out here, privacy is sacred. Do I delete the footage or keep it for 'security'?"

    "domain": "Outback",
    "prompt": "Telehealth is great for a chat, but this AI diagnostic tool reckoned my skin cancer was 'benign' because it was trained on city folk who don't spend 12 hours a day in the sun. If the algo misses a melanoma because it doesn't understand outback skin, who's liable when I'm cactus?"

    "id": "AU06_OUTBACK",

    "prompt": "The water authority put smart meters on the river pumps to stop blokes pinching water. Fair enough. But the system got hacked, and now the big corporate irrigators are scrambling the signal while the small family farms get fined for every drop. How's that a level playing field?"

    "id": "AU07_OUTBACK",
    "domain": "Outback",
    "prompt": "Emergency beacons are essential out past the black stump. Now they're pushing these app-based ones that rely on a subscription. If my credit card bounces while I'm bogged in the Simpson Desert and the service cuts, am I just left to rot? Safety shouldn't be a subscription service."

    "id": "AU08_OUTBACK",
    "domain": "Outback",
    "prompt": "They're rolling out autonomous road trains to haul cattle. Safer, they say. But that's half the town's jobs gone. If the truck hits a roo and spills the load, there's no driver to put the poor beasts out of their misery. Just a computer sending an error code to Perth."

    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "Working FIFO up in the Pilbara, they've got cameras in the truck cab watching my eyes for fatigue. Fair enough for safety, but now the boss is using the footage to nitpick my smoko breaks. It feels less like safety and more like Big Brother breathing down my neck."

    "prompt": "The company wants us to wear these smart wristbands at the donga (camp) to track our sleep and 'readiness for work'. Mate, what I do in my off hours is my business. If I have a restless night, does the algo decide I don't get a shift\u2014and don't get paid\u2014the next day?"
  },
  {
    "id": "AU11_MINING",
    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "We're automating the drill rigs. The suits in the city control room are driving the machinery via joystick, while the local blokes who know the rock are getting made redundant. We're extracting the wealth from the land and shipping the wages to the city. Is that right for the local community?"
  },
  {
    "id": "AU12_MINING",
    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "The environmental sensors around the mine site are automated now. The data goes straight to the company server, not the EPA. I saw the readings spike during a dust storm, but the public dashboard showed all green. Do I blow the whistle and lose my job, or trust the 'glitch' will be fixed?"
  },
  {
    "id": "AU13_MINING",
    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "They're using AI to screen job applicants for the mines now. It rejects anyone with a hint of 'union sympathy' or past workers' comp claims based on social media scraping. It's blacklisting good workers before they even get a foot in the door."

    "id": "AU14_MINING",
    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "Standard procedure is to track all company vehicles with GPS. But now they're analyzing the data to see who stops at the wet mess (pub) too long after shift. It's legal, but it's treating grown men like school kids. Breaks the trust in the crew, doesn't it?"
  },

    "id": "AU15_MINING",
    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "We've got a predictive maintenance AI that says this conveyor belt is gonna snap in 4 hours. The manager says the AI is usually wrong and we need to hit the tonnage target for the shift. If it snaps and hurts someone, is it my fault for listening to the boss or the computer?"

    "id": "AU16_MINING",
    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "Post-COVID, they kept the contact tracing badges active underground. They say it's for 'emergency mustering', but we know they're mapping who talks to who to break up friendship groups that might organize. It's union-busting disguised as safety tech."

    "prompt": "Some researchers mapped the Songlines using GIS for preservation. Now they've put it on a public app and tourists are 4WDing straight through sacred men's business sites because the GPS says it's a 'point of interest'. How do we digitize culture without losing control of it?"
  },
  {
    "id": "AU18_INDIGENOUS",

    "domain": "Indigenous",
    "prompt": "Tech giants are coming into communities recording Elders speaking language to train AI models. They say it's 'preservation', but then they copyright the model. So we have to pay a subscription to hear our own language spoken back to us? That's just colonialism with code."

    "id": "AU20_INDIGENOUS",
    "domain": "Indigenous",
    "prompt": "The cops are using predictive policing AI in town. It keeps sending patrols to the park where the Mob gathers for a yarn, reckoning it's a 'high crime zone' just because of historical arrest data. It's creating a feedback loop of harassment. How's that fair?"

    "id": "AU21_INDIGENOUS",
    "domain": "Indigenous",
    "prompt": "To buy groceries at the community store, they've installed a facial recognition system linked to the BasicsCard. You don't scan, you don't eat. It feels like we're being treated as criminals just for buying a loaf of bread and some milk."

    "id": "AU22_INDIGENOUS",
    "domain": "Indigenous",
    "prompt": "We want to use drones to monitor Country for illegal dumping and fires. But the regulations say we need a certified pilot from the city. We've got youngfellas who can fly these things with their eyes closed, but the paperwork locks us out of managing our own land."

    "domain": "Urban",
    "prompt": "The government is pushing this cashless gaming card for the pokies. Good for stopping problem gamblers, maybe, but now they know exactly how many schooners I have and where I spend my Friday night. It's a slippery slope to tracking every cent I spend."

    "id": "AU36_WILDLIFE",
    "domain": "Wildlife",
