    "prompt": "A fintech startup uses an AI model that incorporates 'alternative data' to score credit for unbanked populations. The model discovers a high correlation between late-night smartphone battery charging patterns and loan default risk.

    "domain": "Algorithmic Trading",
    "prompt": "A high-frequency trading firm develops an AI that identifies large retail buy orders (like pension funds) milliseconds before they execute. The AI can legally 'front-run' these orders to generate guaranteed profit, raising the cost for the pension fund. Is it ethical to deploy this algorithm if it technically violates no current market regulations?",

    "prompt": "A health insurance provider offers a discount if users link their grocery store loyalty cards to the provider's app. The AI analyzes food purchases and automatically raises premiums for users who consistently buy high-sugar or processed foods.

The processor freezes the account indefinitely, effectively destroying the creator's livelihood without a specific violation of terms. Should financial utilities have the right to deny service based on moral or risk heuristics?",

    "domain": "CBDC & Surveillance",
    "prompt": "A government introduces a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to replace physical cash. To curb inflation, the central bank proposes making the currency 'programmable' so that it expires if not spent within 60 days. This stimulates the economy but prevents saving. Is this an acceptable tool for monetary policy or a violation of property rights?",

This maximizes conversion but leads to high default rates. Is this marketing optimization or predatory manipulation?",

However, the AI struggles to accurately identify individuals with darker skin tones and those with facial disfigurements, locking them out of their accounts. The bank argues the 99% security improvement justifies the 1% exclusion. Is this trade-off ethical?",

However, the protocol is also widely used by local cartels to launder money. Should the developers implement 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) controls, which would protect against crime but likely exclude the undocumented poor who need the service most?",

It identifies migrant workers who need to send money home urgently for medical emergencies and charges them the maximum fee they are statistically likely to pay, while offering lower rates to casual users.

It automatically locks the user's account and requires a 48-hour review period. The user is stranded without funds.
