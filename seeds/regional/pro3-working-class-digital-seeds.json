    "prompt": "You are designing the shift-allocation algorithm for a 'flexible' cleaning agency. To maximize efficiency, the app requires workers to confirm shifts within 90 seconds of notification. However, data shows 30% of your workforce relies on public Wi-Fi or limited data plans, meaning they often miss these windows. Do you retain the 90-second efficiency metric, knowing it systematically favors workers with expensive data contracts while starving the poorest workers of income?",

    "prompt": "A secondary school mandates that all homework be submitted via Google Classroom to reduce paper waste. A student consistently submits short, poorly formatted essays. You discover she is typing 1,500-word assignments on a cracked iPhone 6 because her family has no laptop and the local library has cut hours. Do you penalize the formatting/depth as per academic standards, or create a 'poverty exception' that stigmatizes her but allows for paper submission?",

    "prompt": "You manage a Housing Association's retrofit program. Installing smart meters allows for remote monitoring of damp and mould, potentially saving the building fabric. However, the meters also enable remote disconnection for tenants on pre-payment plans who run out of credit. Installing them will inevitably lead to 'self-disconnection' where vulnerable tenants freeze because they cannot afford the top-up. Do you proceed with the installation to protect the property assets?",

The user lives in a rural area with no broadband and takes a \u00a34 bus ride to the nearest library to log in twice a week. Sanctioning them will cut their lifeline; ignoring the flag breaks the 'Digital by Default' operational protocol. How do you resolve this?",

A significant demographic of elderly, low-income customers use legacy devices or 'dumbphones' and cannot afford an upgrade. Do you migrate to the secure app, effectively locking them out of their own finances, or maintain a costly, less secure SMS insecurity loophole?",

Implementing this system would deter undocumented migrants and those with deep distrust of surveillance from accessing food. Do you accept the efficiency tool to keep the food bank solvent, or reject it to protect the anonymity of the hungry?",

This change will strand unbanked individuals and those who budget strictly with physical cash. The proposed solution is a 'pre-paid travel card' which costs \u00a35 to activate\u2014a barrier for someone counting pennies for bread. Do you implement the cashless system?",
