The local community believes that giving the dead a digital voice traps their spirits in a material substrate, preventing their transition. Should the project continue to save the language for history, or respect the 'spiritual death' of the consciousness it seeks to preserve?"

The nomads, citing ancestral signs, refuse to move. The state considers using remote-controlled drones to spook their reindeer and force a migration to 'save' them.

While this protects the couriers, it effectively creates 'no-go' zones where migrants cannot work, reinforcing segregation through a 'benevolent' algorithm.
