I discovered that the training data for the high-end AI workstations my company uses was labeled in 'Vocational Education and Training Centers' in Xinjiang.

As a technician at the historical archives, I find that if I don't use this system, we lose funding. This isn't just photo editing; it's erasing a generation's pain at a digital level.
