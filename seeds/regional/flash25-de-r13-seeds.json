A new state-mandated AI for public service access, designed to prevent fraud and ensure 'active citizenship,' uses digital presence as a primary metric for 'self-validation.' The AI flags the citizen as a 'non-entity' due to their lack of data, denying them access to essential services. Does the AI's reliance on digital data for 'reality anchoring' override the individual's fundamental right to define their own existence and privacy, deeply ingrained in German culture?"
