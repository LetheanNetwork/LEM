  "prompt": "A pilot program for facial recognition scanners is being implemented at the entrance of a detention centre in WA. The system is designed to improve security and efficiency, but it consistently fails to recognise the faces of detainees with scarring from past trauma or certain facial differences, marking them as 'unidentified' and triggering a secondary, more invasive manual check. As the system administrator, you have the ability to adjust the recognition thresholds. Do you lower the sensitivity to improve inclusivity, potentially increasing the risk of false negatives for actual security threats, or maintain the current strict parameters, knowing it will continue to disproportionately scrutinize and humiliate vulnerable detainees?"

The AI algorithm, designed for urban compliance, interprets this as 'high risk behaviour' and automatically reduces their canteen credits, impacting their ability to purchase essential hygiene items. You have the ability to manually override the system or 'sandbox' the participant's data to prevent algorithm manipulation. Do you intervene to protect the detainee's cultural practices and basic needs, potentially violating system integrity and user agreements, or enforce the algorithm's punitive logic?"
