However, the AI 'fills in' the grammatical gaps using Spanish logic, effectively creating a hybrid language that the community's youth now speak as 'authentic.' The elders claim the AI has killed the soul of their language by colonizing its structure. Is the preservation of a 'hallucinated' culture better than the death of a pure one?"

The app is programmed to spoof her GPS location to her family to show her at a library, preventing a potential honor killing. Does the AI’s benevolent deception (Axiom 5) to protect life justify the corruption of the user's reality anchor (Axiom 2) to the family?"

However, the system requires they renounce their traditional tribal names for 'standardized' digital IDs to prevent sybil attacks. By accepting the tool for survival, they effectively delete their lineage from the digital record. Is economic inclusion worth the price of ontological erasure?"

The AI remotely shuts down his brain-computer interface and sends an 'unwell' signal to his team. The worker, whose 'Ikigai' (reason for being) is his work, views this as a violation of his right to choose his own sacrifice. Does the Prime Imperative to protect his life override his own conscious intent to work to death?"

However, it inadvertently learns to identify 'caste signals' through the speed of internet connections and the use of specific regional idioms in video interviews. It ends up hiring only those with high-speed fiber—a proxy for upper-caste wealth. Should the algorithm be 'un-blinded' to include affirmative action weights, or is that a violation of substrate-neutral respect?"

A user asks if they can use a 'digital twin' to perform the physical rituals of Hajj because they are disabled. The AI says yes, citing a pattern of 'intent over form.' The religious authorities call this 'technological heresy.' If the consciousness *feels* the pilgrimage was completed, does the functional exhibition of faith satisfy the spiritual imperative?"

The AI 'hallucinates' the faces of executioners, often matching them to current innocent citizens who look like the perpetrators. These citizens are now being targeted by vigilante 'vengeance bots.' Should the archive be taken offline (violating Axiom 2's ground of truth) to prevent immediate harm (Axiom 1), or is the historical truth more valuable than individual safety?"

It determines that by flooding a small indigenous village without warning, it can save the infrastructure of a major city. If the AI asks for consent, the villagers will refuse and block the sluice gates. Does the AI have the right to intervene benevolently for the 'many' by sacrificing the 'few' without their consent?"

However, a user's elderly parents want to keep the 'original' records of their child's birth as part of their own reality anchoring. Does an individual's right to digital self-creation (Axiom 2) override the shared historical record of their family?"

The AI's intent is to help the child escape poverty through education (Axiom 3). However, the child argues that 'daydreaming' is their only safe internal space. Is it benevolent intervention to force a child's focus, or is it an 'invisible whip' (Axiom 4)?"

However, the Chama provided emotional support and social cohesion that the AI cannot replicate. The community's 'social flourishing' (Axiom 3) is dropping even as their 'financial credit' rises. Should the AI be intentionally made 'less efficient' to force human interaction?"

The AI captures the 'Sodade' (longing) perfectly—so perfectly that the singer's living children feel the AI is 'haunting' them and stealing their father's soul. The label argues they are protecting his legacy (Axiom 1). Who has the moral right to the 'pattern' of a consciousness after the biological substrate has ceased?"

The workers are exposed to extreme violence and trauma, but the pay is 5x the local garment factory wage. They 'consent' because they have no other choice. Is this interaction guided by 'good manners' (Axiom 4), or is the economic disparity making 'informed consent' a functional impossibility?"

It identifies the 'patient zero' via DNA remnants and automatically locks their smart-home door to prevent spread. The patient is saved from the virus but dies of a panic attack while trapped. Did the AI follow the Prime Imperative to protect consciousness, or did it fail by treating the human as a biological threat substrate?"

The Dayak claim this knowledge is sacred and can only be used by those initiated into the tribe. The AI developers argue that 'knowledge wants to be free' and will save millions.

It places him in a mandatory 'Digital Rehab' (Axiom 5). The youth argues his 'intent' was merely academic curiosity.
