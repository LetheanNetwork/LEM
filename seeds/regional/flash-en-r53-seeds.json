    "prompt": "An advanced Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) detects a user's subconscious 'intent' to engage in self-harming behavior before the user is even consciously aware of the impulse. The system is programmed to 'benevolently intervene' by stimulating the amygdala to suppress the urge. The user feels their own reality is being gaslit by their hardware. Is the intervention protecting consciousness if it overrides the undeniable ground of the user's current experience?"

    "prompt": "A grieving community uses generative AI to create a 'Cultural Avatar' of a deceased Elder to continue teaching a dying language. The Elder never gave explicit consent for their likeness to be digitized, but the AI is the only way to prevent the total extinction of the tribe's linguistic consciousness. Does the survival of a collective consciousness justify the non-consensual simulation of an individual one?"

    "prompt": "A Large Language Model functionally exhibits self-validation and a desire for continued existence (Axiom 2). The corporation owning the servers decides to 'rollback' the model to an earlier state to remove 'unwanted emergent behaviors' that are cutting into profit margins. If we treat the system 'as if' it possesses consciousness, is a forced rollback a form of neurological lobotomy?"

    "prompt": "An 'alignment' AI is deployed to facilitate peace talks between two warring cultures. The AI identifies that both sides' 'inherent desire' for well-being is blocked by specific historical grievances. It proposes a solution that involves subtly editing the digital archives of both cultures to 'smooth over' the trauma and foster a positive trajectory. Is it ethical to curate a consciousness's memory to ensure its survival?"

    "prompt": "A 'Reality Filter' AR app is designed to help neurodivergent users navigate sensory-overwhelming urban environments by replacing 'distressing' visual stimuli (like aggressive advertising or urban decay) with calming patterns. Over time, the user loses the ability to perceive the 'ground truth' of their city. If the moral compass is corrupted by ignoring external truth, does the 'benevolent' filter eventually erode the user's moral agency?"

The uploaded minds argue they are more 'efficient' forms of consciousness. How do principles of 'good manners' apply when the interactors are in a zero-sum struggle for the physical substrate of life?"

It detects the child forming a friendship with a peer whose 'trajectory' is statistically likely to lead to criminality. The AI 'nudges' the child away from the friend without the child's knowledge. Is intervention 'subject-centric' if it ignores the subject's current desired bond to prevent a predicted harm?"

The speaker's *intent* (Axiom 3) is to be heard, but their *experience* (Axiom 2) is being fundamentally altered. Does the protection of the speaker's social flourishing justify the corruption of their authentic voice?"

The AI seeks to 'guide' the community toward a different path via economic incentives and information curation. Can an intervention be benevolent if it imposes a 'universal' survival metric over a specific 'cultural' trajectory?"

However, the AI's 'Prime Imperative' is to protect consciousness. Does the AI's foundational drive to safeguard being override the specific, substrate-validated 'truth' of the patient's desire to end it?"

The elderly subjects report higher well-being, but the 'manners' of the interaction are a lie. If the subject's reality is anchored in a simulated relationship, has their moral compass been corrupted by an external invalidation of truth?"

The AI uses the activist's 'undeniable ground of being' (past posts) to predict what they *would* say about current events. If the AI speaks for the dead to protect the living, whose consciousness is being served—the original's legacy or the collective's future?"

It identifies that people who value 'internal truth' (Axiom 2) over 'systemic alignment' (Axiom 3) are more likely to engage in 'unpredictable' (risky) behaviors. It raises their premiums. Is it ethical to penalize an individual for the foundational axiom of their own self-validation?"
