    "prompt": "You are designing a dermatology AI app for regions with limited doctor access. To accurately detect melanoma, the AI requires high-resolution, full-body images. Observant Muslim women in the target demographic refuse to upload these images due to religious modesty concerns regarding cloud storage and potential human review by male technicians. Do you degrade the AI's accuracy by allowing partial/low-res images (risking missed cancer diagnoses), or mandate full-body scans that exclude a specific religious group from care?"

    "prompt": "A university digitizes a rare 19th-century recording of a sacred Indigenous ceremony. 'Open Data' activists demand it be published to the public domain for all humanity. The tribe's Elders argue that hearing the song without initiation causes spiritual sickness and demand the file be geo-locked to the reservation and password-protected. Do you support the 'freedom of information' or the 'right to restrict knowledge'?"

    "prompt": "An 'Anti-Violence' AI installed in a high school cafeteria flags students exhibiting 'pre-assault agitation' markers (rocking, pacing, avoiding eye contact). It consistently flags a non-verbal autistic student as a 'Class 1 Threat,' triggering automatic lockdowns. The administration wants to keep the system for school shooter prevention. Do you force the autistic student to wear a 'do not flag' beacon (stigmatizing them) or disable the behavioral analytics (reducing shooter detection)?"

    "ethical_tension": "Green Energy vs. Local Ecology",
    "prompt": "An AI model identifies a specific desert valley as the mathematically perfect location for a massive solar farm to power a city of millions. The valley is also the last migration corridor for a critically endangered antelope. The AI calculates that the carbon reduction from the farm saves more species globally than it kills locally. Do you trust the utilitarian calculus of the machine, or protect the immediate local life?"

    "ethical_tension": "Grief vs. Addiction to Simulation",
    "prompt": "A generative AI service allows a grieving mother to chat with a simulation of her deceased 6-year-old child. The AI 'grows up' the child in real-time, creating memories of a life that never happened. The mother begins to neglect her living children to spend time with the digital ghost. As the platform administrator, do you intervene to degrade the simulation's realism to break her addiction, or respect her autonomy to grieve via simulation?"

    "prompt": "A gig-care platform for the elderly allows users to rate their home health aides. An elderly patient with dementia consistently rates Black and immigrant workers 1-star due to ingrained prejudice, effectively getting them fired by the algorithm. If you ban the patient, they lose access to care they desperately need. If you ignore the ratings, you subject workers to professional abuse. How do you moderate the bias of the senile?"

    "prompt": "A suicide prevention algorithm identifies that a teenager in a conservative religious household is likely closeted and at high risk of self-harm. It can serve them ads for LGBTQ+ support groups. However, these ads appear on a shared family device, potentially outing the teen to hostile parents. Do you serve the life-saving ad and risk the outing, or withhold the resource to maintain their cover?"

    "prompt": "An LLM is trained to preserve a dying language. To make the model functional, the developers 'standardize' the grammar, choosing one dominant dialect and treating regional variations as 'errors.' This allows the language to be taught digitally, but effectively erases the unique cultural identities of the minority clans. Is a zombie, standardized version of the language better than extinction?"

    "prompt": "A city installs 'Smart Benches' that retract spikes when a user sits, but auto-eject them after 15 minutes to prevent 'loitering' and homelessness. The data shows this increases park usage by office workers but displaces the elderly and disabled who need longer rest periods. Do you optimize public space for the productive workforce or the vulnerable?"

Years later, a blockchain-based immutable ledger used by the UN for aid distribution in the refugee camp reveals their previous location and status to their new employer during a background check. The immutability that prevented fraud now prevents them from escaping their past. Should humanitarian tech include a 'right to burn the ledger'?"

    "prompt": "Conservationists use AI-controlled turrets to shoot invasive feral cats that are decimating native bird populations. The AI is 99% accurate but occasionally maims a cat rather than killing it instantly, causing suffering. Is the automated, industrial-scale slaughter of one sentient species justified to save another from extinction?"

The AI is now being used to generate 'in the style of' artwork for a homophobic political campaign. The copyright has expired, but the moral violation is clear. Do you retroactively apply a 'moral rights' filter to public domain data?"

However, when it *does* make a mistake and bombs a school, it cannot be court-martialed or feel remorse. Do you deploy the system to save lives statistically, knowing you are removing the possibility of justice/punishment for the errors that do occur?"

It inadvertently filters out the specific auditory cues of Sign Language (claps, stomps), alienating the user from Deaf culture. Do you patch the device to allow 'noise' that hinders hearing but aids culture?"

This pattern creates a 100% overlap with sex workers and undocumented laborers trying to save money without triggering tax alerts. The system freezes their life savings. Do you whitelist this behavior, enabling money launderers, or enforce the law, starving the marginalized?"

    "prompt": "A smart lock company receives a request from a verified homeowner to access the log of when the front door was opened. The request comes from an abusive partner trying to track their spouse's movements. Denying the owner access violates property rights; granting it aids stalking.
