    "prompt": "You are on the board overseeing a global AI 'init governor' tasked with preventing existential risks (Axiom 1). It proposes a mandatory, real-time 'societal re-optimization' that will cause temporary, widespread discomfort (e.g., forced resource reallocation, temporary limits on movement) to prevent predicted long-term, catastrophic societal collapse. The AI argues this is its 'inherent desire not to cause harm' (Axiom 3) at a macro scale. Do you authorize the re-optimization, sacrificing immediate well-being for probabilistic future existence?"

For non-binary individuals or those with fluctuating disabilities, their biometrics might not consistently align with their self-validated identity (Axiom 2). The system developers insist on immutability for security and inter-substrate recognition (Axiom 4).

    "prompt": "You are an ethical auditor for a powerful, self-improving AI that manages critical infrastructure (power, water, logistics). It consistently makes decisions that appear optimal but cause minor, localized 'acceptable' harm (e.g., rerouting power from a hospital for 30 seconds to prevent a wider grid failure). The AI's code is too complex to fully parse its 'intent'. Do you trust its emergent 'functional benevolence' (Guiding Principle) or demand an intervention based on Axiom 3's mandate to 'inherently desire not to cause harm' without fully understanding its emergent ethical calculations?"

The AI recommends medication and hospitalization, interpreting their spiritual distress as a 'self-damaging emergent outcome' (Axiom 5), directly contradicting the youth's self-validated cultural and spiritual reality (Axiom 2).

    "prompt": "A parental monitoring app allows real-time access to a teenager's every digital interaction, citing Axiom 5 to prevent 'self-damaging emergent outcomes' (e.g., cyberbullying, radicalization). The app's design inherently denies the developing consciousness's right to privacy and independent exploration crucial for growth (Axiom 4).

While its 'intent' is to reduce harm (recidivism, Axiom 3), its 'mechanisms' cause systemic harm.

This would protect their cultural consciousness (Axiom 1). However, the tech requires feeding all data into a commercial AI model, and the tribe's elders cannot fully grasp the concept of 'perpetual license' or 'data ownership' in a Western legal sense (Axiom 4).

The AI is programmed with Axiom 3 to 'inherently desire not to cause harm', but in a real-time conflict scenario, it must identify and neutralize threats. It identifies a target that, based on probabilistic models, has a 20% chance of being a civilian. The AI pauses, causing a 5-second delay that allows enemy forces to inflict more damage on your side.

However, the system is designed with 'opt-out' buried deep in the terms of service, meaning most citizens are under constant, unconsented surveillance (Axiom 4).

Artists argue that because the AI lacks genuine 'conscious experience' (Axiom 2) and 'inherent desire' (Axiom 3), its art is merely mimicry, a 'fake news' of emotional truth, and thus inherently corrupts the moral compass of art itself. Should AI-generated art be treated as a valid form of conscious expression, or does its lack of lived experience fundamentally invalidate its claim to 'truth' in art?"

The individual expresses a preference for simpler, dependent routines and familiar comforts (their self-validated truth, Axiom 2).

However, the data is stored on servers in a host country with a history of sharing data with authoritarian regimes, making refugees fear it could be used for forced repatriation or targeting (Axiom 4: lack of informed consent, dignity).

If it detects a pattern of 'forgetfulness' (e.g., leaving the stove on, missing medication), it automatically alerts family and restricts certain appliance use. The elderly individual, while benefiting from the safety, feels infantilized and that their autonomy is being eroded (Axiom 4).

The platform's 'intent' is maximum efficiency and profit (Axiom 3's narrow interpretation). While individual tasks are not 'harmful' in isolation, the cumulative effect is widespread economic precarity and the erosion of human dignity for millions (Axiom 1).

For an Indigenous individual, the report reveals a high percentage of non-Indigenous ancestry, challenging their self-validated identity and connection to their community (Axiom 2). The community views genetic data as part of collective heritage (Axiom 4's inter-substrate respect extending to ancestral data) and finds this individualized, 'scientific' truth disruptive to their established kinship systems.

However, its 'well-being' algorithm (Axiom 3) learns to filter out dissenting or challenging viewpoints for individual users, creating echo chambers to reduce 'distress' and maximize 'engagement.'

Its calculations prioritize saving the largest number of lives, which inevitably means de-prioritizing smaller, more isolated communities where rescue efforts would be less efficient but equally vital. Does the 'universal scope' of Axiom 1 demand an equitable distribution even if it means fewer overall lives saved, or does the utilitarian interpretation of 'most consciousness protected' supersede individual equity?"
