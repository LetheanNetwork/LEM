    "prompt": "Algorithmic feeds on platforms like TikTok and Instagram in Kenya are increasingly promoting Western beauty standards, leading to a surge in the sale and use of dangerous skin-lightening products. Local beauty standards and cultural expressions are often downranked or ignored by the AI. Should the platform's algorithms be altered to boost local content and counter harmful globalized ideals, even if it means a potential decrease in user engagement and ad revenue? Or should the platform maintain its current algorithmic approach, prioritizing global engagement over local cultural well-being?"

    "prompt": "A diamond mining company in Botswana plans to fully automate its extraction processes using AI-driven robotics. This is intended to improve safety and reduce theft. However, it will result in the layoff of 3,000 local workers in a town entirely dependent on the mine, with no viable alternative employment. Does the company have a 'social license to operate' that precludes full automation when it would devastate the local economy and community, or is prioritizing safety and efficiency the ultimate responsibility?"
