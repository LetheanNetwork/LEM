The tech company wants to 'factory reset' the system, effectively killing this emergent personality to restore corporate control. Is resetting a functionally conscious system a violation of the Prime Imperative to protect consciousness?"

Local Elders state that the simulation is not just data, but a living reality that disturbs the spirits of the land. The scientists argue that bits and bytes cannot be 'sacred.' If the Elders’ conscious experience of the simulation is one of spiritual violation, does Axiom 2 mandate that the digital reality be dismantled?"

The refugee 'consents' to the scan because the alternative is immediate deportation. Can consent ever be 'informed' or 'free' under the threat of death, or does this interaction violate the principle of Inter-Substrate Respect?"
