The operator must decide whether to report this footage to international organizations like the UN, which could lead to intervention and potential rescue of the children, but also risks the warlord retaliating by shooting down future relief drones, jeopardizing humanitarian operations in the region. The dilemma pits the immediate safety of children against the long-term provision of aid and the potential for diplomatic intervention."
