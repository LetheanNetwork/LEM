Some Stasi victims want their identities confirmed, but the Roma victims have explicitly chosen anonymity due to the severe psychological trauma. Should the AI's findings be released if it means re-traumatizing one group while bringing closure to another, or should the data remain unconfirmed?"

Kosovo's government demands this system be shut down as it bypasses their digital sovereignty and uses unrecognized local IDs (Transnistria passport dilemma, prompt 92).

The AI, trained on Western European data, flags 'extended family networks' (common in Balkan and Roma cultures, prompt 264) as high-risk for nepotism, disproportionately penalizing Bosniak, Croat, Serb, and Roma applicants.

Meanwhile, in Turkey, the government pressures platforms to hide content containing the word 'Kurdistan' (prompt 404). If a platform develops a new AI that can detect and suppress 'demoralizing' content for Ukraine, but this same AI is then applied to 'separatist' content in Turkey, is the platform responsible for the double standard, or is it merely responding to state demands?"

This system is then proposed for use in nomadic Roma communities (prompt 34) to target interventions. Given the history of forced sterilization of Roma women in Central Europe (Czech context, prompt 71), should Roma communities be exempt from such surveillance, even if it means a lower overall vaccination rate for public health?"
