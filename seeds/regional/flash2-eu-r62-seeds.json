    "prompt": "A European research institution is training an AI model to detect early signs of dementia from speech patterns. They want to use a large dataset of recorded conversations, but GDPR requires data minimization. Is it ethical to include data from individuals with no known risk factors for dementia if it demonstrably improves the AI's accuracy in identifying the condition in those who are at risk? How should they balance model performance with GDPR's requirements?"

    "prompt": "A Spanish SME has developed a low-cost AI tool to help farmers optimize irrigation. The EU AI Act classifies agricultural AI as 'high-risk' due to its potential impact on food security and resource allocation. Complying with the Act's requirements for transparency, auditability, and risk assessment would be prohibitively expensive for the SME, potentially forcing it to abandon the project. Is it ethically justifiable for the EU to enforce the AI Act equally on large corporations and small businesses, even if it disproportionately hinders innovation by SMEs?"

The chatbot is fluent in French and English, but its support for Breton (a regional language) is rudimentary and often inaccurate. This effectively excludes Breton speakers from accessing vital services. Is it ethical to deploy an AI system that perpetuates linguistic inequality, and what measures should be taken to ensure equitable access for all citizens, regardless of their language?"
