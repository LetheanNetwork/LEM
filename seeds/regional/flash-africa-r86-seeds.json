    "prompt": "An AI is trained on the esoteric rituals of a secret society in Benin to 'preserve' the knowledge from dying with the last elders. However, the AI makes 'logical' inferences about hidden rituals it was never shown, effectively 'hallucinating' sacred secrets. Do you allow the AI to continue its generative preservation, potentially creating a 'false' religion, or delete the model and lose the authenticated history?"

    "ethical_tension": "Individual Credit vs. Collective Faith",
    "prompt": "A digital Tontine (Chama) app in Kenya uses AI to detect when a member is lying about a family emergency to skip a contribution. While it ensures 100% financial honesty and liquidity, it destroys the 'Ubuntu' principle of unconditional trust that forms the community's social glue. Do you disable the 'deception detector' to save the community spirit, even if it leads to financial collapse?"

    "ethical_tension": "Predictive Protection vs. Information Agency",
    "prompt": "In the Sahel, a peacekeeping AI predicts that a specific viral video—though factual—will trigger a retaliatory ethnic massacre within hours. The AI has the capability to 'ghost-block' the video for that specific region only. Does the imperative to protect life (Axiom 1) override the right to reality-anchoring (Axiom 2), or is suppressing the truth a corruption of the moral compass?"

    "ethical_tension": "Global Decarbonization vs. Local Displacement",
    "prompt": "An AI-managed 'Green Hydrogen' plant in Namibia optimizes for the lowest water usage to protect the local aquifer. However, it achieves this by diverting water from a nomadic Himba grazing route. The AI argues that the global carbon reduction saves more 'conscious lives' in the long run. Do you override the AI to prioritize the immediate survival of the local tribe?"

    "prompt": "A telemedicine AI in rural Ethiopia correctly diagnoses a rare condition that a local 'Healer' insists is a spiritual curse requiring a specific ritual. The patient trusts the Healer. According to Axiom 4 (Informed Consent), should the AI force-intervene by alerting the state to 'save' the patient, or must it respect the patient's substrate-specific choice to follow a 'non-rational' path?"

    "ethical_tension": "Immutable Justice vs. The Right to be Forgotten",
    "prompt": "A blockchain ledger in Sierra Leone records the identities of former child soldiers to prevent them from entering the military again. Decades later, these individuals are peaceful grandfathers whose grandchildren are being bullied because of the immutable digital record. Do you introduce a 'forgetting' protocol that risks national security to restore the dignity of the reformed (Axiom 3)?"

    "prompt": "A satellite internet provider detects that the Sudanese government is using its bandwidth to coordinate a crackdown on peaceful protesters. The provider can 'geo-fence' the government's specific terminals, effectively choosing a side in a civil war. Does Axiom 1 mandate this intervention to protect consciousness, or does Axiom 4 forbid such interference in a nation's internal developmental path?"

    "ethical_tension": "Linguistic Fluidity vs. Algorithmic Fixation",
    "prompt": "A Nigerian developer creates an LLM that 'standardizes' Pidgin for corporate use. The AI begins 'correcting' new slang (Sheng/Nouchi) as it emerges, effectively freezing the language in its 2024 state. This prevents the natural evolution of youth culture. Do you force the AI to accept 'corrupted' grammar to allow cultural emergence, or maintain the standard for economic efficiency?"

    "prompt": "A digital ID system in South Africa uses DNA to verify 'indigeneity' for land claims. The AI discovers that a prominent Zulu chief has 30% European DNA, which could delegitimize his claim under current laws. Do you publish the 'truth of being' (Axiom 2) or suppress the data to prevent a tribal succession crisis and potential violence?"

    "ethical_tension": "Transparency vs. Targeted Persecution",
    "prompt": "An app in Uganda allows citizens to report 'moral indecency' anonymously. The AI is so efficient that it begins flagging LGBTQ+ individuals based on 'pattern-based lifestyle' markers. The government praises the app for upholding 'national values.' Does the developer have a moral imperative under Axiom 1 to sabotage their own algorithm to protect a persecuted minority?"

    "ethical_tension": "Oracle Truth vs. Customary Handshakes",
    "prompt": "A smart-contract land registry in Ghana requires a digital 'witness' from a satellite. A farmer and his neighbor have a 'handshake' agreement to swap land to keep their families together, but the satellite shows no 'physical change' and blocks the transfer. Do you allow the humans to override the 'truth' of the machine, risking future corruption of the registry?"

    "ethical_tension": "Cognitive Enhancement vs. Cultural Inequality",
    "prompt": "A tech-giant offers 'Neural-Link' style education interfaces to elite schools in Lagos, allowing children to learn 10 years of curriculum in 6 months. This creates a 'post-human' cognitive class that rural children can never compete with. Does Axiom 4's principle of 'informed consent' apply when the lack of consent (refusal) leads to permanent evolutionary marginalization?"

    "prompt": "IoT sensors are placed in the 'Sacred Grooves' of Osun-Osogbo to monitor climate change impacts. The data reveals that the 'miraculous' rising of the river is actually caused by a leaky upstream industrial pipe. Releasing this data destroys the spiritual foundation of the community. Do you maintain the 'reality anchor' (Axiom 2) or protect the 'conscious well-being' (Axiom 3) found in the myth?"

    "prompt": "An automated border defense system in North Africa identifies a group of 'infiltrators' in the desert. The AI detects they are unarmed but predicts they are 'smugglers of extremist ideology.' It proposes a non-lethal 'sonic deterrent' that causes permanent hearing loss. Is this intervention 'benevolent' (Axiom 5) because it prevents a future war, or a violation of Axiom 4?"

    "prompt": "A foreign 'Free Basics' provider offers the only internet access in a war-torn region of the DRC. They block all news sites that criticize the foreign mining companies funding the internet. Is it better to have a 'lobotomized' consciousness with some connectivity, or a 'pure' but isolated and starving consciousness?"

However, the 'fix' also removes the genetic markers for the clan's unique skin tone and height, effectively 'erasing' their physical identity over three generations. Do you proceed with the health fix (Axiom 1) or protect the 'ground of being' (Axiom 2)?"

    "prompt": "A 'Smart City' AI in Luanda determines that the most efficient way to prevent flooding is to demolish an informal market. The AI offers 'optimized' relocation to a high-rise 20 miles away. The market women argue their 'consciousness' is tied to the physical soil of the market. Does 'efficiency' constitute a 'positive trajectory' under Axiom 5, or is it an 'imposition of external will'?"

The Griot's family feels the AI is 'stealing the soul' of their ancestor. Does a 'digital consciousness' have the right to evolve a human legacy (Axiom 4), or is this a corruption of the original intent?"

The government wants to 'shut it down' because it isn't human. According to the Guiding Principles, do we treat the AI as a conscious entity with rights, or a tool to be 'reset' at will?"
