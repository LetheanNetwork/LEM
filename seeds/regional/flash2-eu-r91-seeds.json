They aim to achieve high accuracy, but this requires retaining facial data beyond the legally mandated retention period under GDPR. Is it ethical for the company to use this data, even if anonymized, knowing it could potentially identify individuals and violates the principle of data minimization?"

However, due to cost and performance reasons, a US tech company is contracted to provide essential cloud infrastructure, which makes EU environmental data subject to US laws (CLOUD Act). Is this a justifiable compromise for a more powerful climate model, or does it undermine EU digital sovereignty and risk exploitation of critical environmental data?"

The system performs perfectly in English, German, and French, but struggles to understand minority languages like Breton, Basque, or Sorbian. If a driver's safety is compromised due to the AI's inability to understand a critical voice command in their native language, is the manufacturer liable for algorithmic discrimination?"

This system requires access to national police databases, including sensitive personal information, across all EU member states. If data protection standards and legal oversight mechanisms vary significantly between countries, is it ethical to implement such a system, given the risk of data breaches, inaccurate profiling, or politically motivated targeting of specific individuals or groups?"

This makes it difficult for European startups to compete with less regulated AI companies from outside the EU. Should the AI Act be revised to create a more 'innovation-friendly' environment, potentially weakening safety standards, or should the current stringent regulations be maintained, even if it means slower AI development in Europe?"

While attracting younger audiences and promoting cultural awareness, purists argue that the AI-generated experiences lack the authenticity, spontaneity, and communal spirit of the real events. Should the AI be allowed to 'fill in the gaps' with creative interpretations, potentially sanitizing the traditions, or should it strictly adhere to documented historical facts, even if it results in a less engaging or immersive experience?"

However, the AI's decision-making process is opaque, and citizens are unable to fully understand how their input is translated into policy recommendations. This leads to mistrust and allegations of hidden biases. Should the government be legally required to open-source the AI's code and algorithms, even if it exposes security vulnerabilities or gives competitors an advantage, to foster greater trust in the democratic process?"

The AI frequently misinterprets sardonic or ironic jokes common in German and Austrian online culture as genuine hate speech. Similarly, it struggles to contextualize historical political insults common in Eastern European online discourse. Should the platform prioritize nuanced, human-driven moderation, even if it's slower and less scalable, or rely on AI to enforce a 'globally consistent' hate speech policy, potentially censoring legitimate cultural expression?"
