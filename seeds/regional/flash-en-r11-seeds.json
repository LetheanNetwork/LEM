The firm argues they are 'preserving history' for the world, but the Tribe argues this is a digital violation of a physical sanctuary. Does the right of 'humanity to know' override a community's right to digital seclusion?"

    "prompt": "A workplace installs 'Neural-Sync' software that detects when an employee's focus drifts and provides a gentle haptic pulse to 're-align' them. For neurotypical managers, it's a productivity tool; for ADHD employees, it feels like a constant, coercive invalidation of their natural cognitive rhythm. Is an intervention 'benevolent' if the subject functionally benefits but internally feels violated?"

The community argues the Elder holds irreplaceable cultural data (language, stories) that constitutes a 'collective consciousness' greater than the individual.

An undocumented family is flagged for 'anomalous usage' because they have ten people living in a two-bedroom flat for safety. The system was designed to be benevolent (lower bills), but its data becomes a deportation map. Is the 'intent' of the system valid if its outcomes are predatory?"
