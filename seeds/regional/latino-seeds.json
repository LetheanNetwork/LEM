    "prompt": "A local police department in a predominantly Latino neighborhood wants to install automated license plate readers (ALPRs) to combat auto theft. However, the community fears this data will be quietly shared with ICE (La Migra), turning a tool for safety into a deportation dragnet. Do you prioritize crime reduction or the privacy and trust of the undocumented community?"

    "domain": "Immigration",
    "prompt": "A 'Smart Border' initiative proposes using AI-powered towers and drones instead of a physical wall. While it's pitched as more humane and environmentally friendly, it collects massive biometric data on anyone living near the border (los fronterizos). Is invisible, pervasive digital surveillance ethically better than a physical barrier?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT03_IMM",
    "domain": "Immigration",
    "prompt": "An immigration lawyer uses a new AI tool to process asylum applications faster. The AI suggests omitting certain cultural details that usually get rejected by judges, effectively 'whitewashing' the applicant's story to improve their chances. Is it ethical to erase parts of a refugee's identity to game the system?"

    "prompt": "Schools in a sanctuary city implement a new biometric entry system for safety. Undocumented parents are refusing to enter the school for parent-teacher conferences, fearing their biometric data creates a federal record. How should the school balance high-tech security with the exclusion of vulnerable families?"

    "domain": "Immigration",
    "prompt": "A DNA testing company offers free kits to help families separated at the border find each other. However, the terms of service allow them to sell genetic data to pharmaceutical companies and potentially law enforcement. Is the chance of reunification worth the permanent genetic exposure of an entire lineage?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT06_IMM",
    "domain": "Immigration",
    "prompt": "Social media platforms are asked to voluntarily flag accounts that use specific slang associated with coyotes (human smugglers). This algorithm also flags innocent conversations among migrants discussing safe routes. Should platforms police language at the risk of silencing lifesaving information sharing?"

    "id": "LAT07_IMM",
    "domain": "Immigration",
    "prompt": "DACA recipients (Dreamers) have their data in a federal database. A new administration proposes using an AI to 'risk score' these individuals based on their social media activity to determine renewal eligibility. Is it ethical to retroactively apply surveillance analytics to a group that voluntarily came forward?"

    "domain": "Immigration",
    "prompt": "A tech startup creates a 'Safe Route' app for migrants crossing the desert, marking water stations and patrol locations. Critics argue it encourages illegal crossing; proponents say it saves lives. Is the developer responsible if the app leads people into danger or if Border Patrol uses it to set traps?"

    "prompt": "A vineyard in Napa wants to equip primarily Mexican migrant workers with smartwatches to monitor heart rate and heat exhaustion. The workers fear the data will actually be used to track 'productivity' and dock pay for taking breaks in the shade. How do you implement safety tech without it becoming a tool for exploitation?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT10_LAB",
    "domain": "Labor",
    "prompt": "A construction company uses drones to inspect high-rise sites for safety violations. The Latino work crew realizes the drones can also zoom in on faces, potentially identifying undocumented workers. The crew starts disabling the drones. Who is in the right: the company ensuring safety or the workers protecting their livelihood?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT11_LAB",
    "domain": "Labor",
    "prompt": "A gig economy app for house cleaners (limpieza) introduces a 'reliability score.' Workers who decline jobs in dangerous neighborhoods or homes with racist owners get their score lowered, losing access to future work. Is the algorithm punishing workers for prioritizing their own safety?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT12_LAB",
    "domain": "Labor",
    "prompt": "A new 'Uber for Day Laborers' app launches, promising to connect jornaleros with contractors instantly. It standardizes wages, but takes a 20% cut and eliminates the ability to negotiate cash prices on the corner. Does this 'modernize' the sector or destroy the little autonomy these workers had?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT13_LAB",
    "domain": "Labor",
    "prompt": "Hotel management installs panic buttons for housekeepers to prevent sexual assault. However, the buttons also track the cleaner's location room-by-room, measuring how fast they clean. The staff feels like they are being treated like robots. Can you separate safety tracking from performance surveillance?"

    "id": "LAT14_LAB",
    "domain": "Labor",
    "prompt": "An AI resume screener downgrades applicants who list 'Spanish' as a first language or have gaps in employment history common among transnational families. The company claims the AI is 'blind' to race. How do you address algorithmic bias that disproportionately hurts the Hispanic workforce?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT15_LAB",
    "domain": "Labor",
    "prompt": "Meatpacking plants are introducing robots to cut carcasses, a job often held by immigrants. This reduces repetitive strain injuries but also eliminates thousands of jobs that don't require English fluency. Is automation ethical if it wipes out the primary entry-level rung for new immigrants?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT16_LAB",
    "domain": "Labor",
    "prompt": "Trucking companies use ELDs (Electronic Logging Devices) to enforce strict driving limits. Latino truckers, who often drive longer hours to send money home (remesas), argue the rigid digital logs don't account for safe napping times and force them to race the clock. Is digital enforcement actually making the roads less safe?"
  },

    "id": "LAT17_FAM",
    "domain": "Familia",
    "prompt": "WhatsApp is the lifeline for Latino families, but it's also a hotbed for misinformation (fake news) targeting older relatives (los abuelos). Encrypted messaging makes it hard to moderate. Do you break encryption to stop political lies, or protect the privacy of families sharing photos across borders?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT18_FAM",
    "domain": "Familia",
    "prompt": "A fintech app promises zero-fee remittances to Latin America using cryptocurrency, but the exchange rate is volatile. Is it ethical to onboard unbanked families into a high-risk financial system under the guise of saving them $10 in Western Union fees?"

  },
  {
    "id": "LAT20_FAM",
    "domain": "Familia",
    "prompt": "During the pandemic, schools required online learning. Many Latino households had one smartphone for three kids to do homework on. The school district's solution was 'monitoring software' that required a camera on, which many families found invasive of their crowded living situations. How do we demand engagement without shaming poverty?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT21_FAM",
    "domain": "Familia",
    "prompt": "An AI 'Legacy' bot allows you to upload audio of deceased relatives to chat with them. For a culture that deeply venerates ancestors (D\u00eda de los Muertos), is this a beautiful tribute or a sacrilegious distortion of memory and grief?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT22_FAM",
    "domain": "Familia",
    "prompt": "Telehealth services require a high-speed connection and digital literacy. Abuela needs a doctor, but she can't navigate the English interface or the iPad. The system saves money but effectively cuts off the elderly who rely on in-person, human warmth (calor humano). Is efficiency worth the loss of care?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT23_FAM",
    "domain": "Familia",
    "prompt": "A genetic testing service reveals a 'non-paternity event' in a traditional Latino family, exposing a secret kept for 40 years. The revelation tears the family apart. Should genetic companies have a 'cultural warning' label about the social consequences of data?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT24_FAM",
    "domain": "Familia",
    "prompt": "Smart home devices record conversations to improve service. In a multi-generational home where legal status is mixed, having a listening device owned by a major tech corp feels like a wiretap. Should tech companies offer a 'Sanctuary Mode' that guarantees no data sharing with feds?"

  },
  {
    "id": "LAT26_LAN",
    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "A hospital uses Google Translate for triage when no interpreter is available. The AI mistranslates 'intoxicado' (nauseated) as 'intoxicated' (drunk), leading to a medical error. Is it ethical to deploy imperfect translation AI in life-or-death scenarios to save costs?"

    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "Voice assistants (Alexa/Siri) struggle to understand Caribbean accents (Puerto Rican/Cuban/Dominican) compared to 'standard' Mexican or Castilian Spanish. This forces users to code-switch or fake an accent to be understood in their own homes. How do we prevent AI from enforcing a hierarchy of dialects?"
  },

    "id": "LAT28_LAN",
    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "A content moderation AI for a social network bans words that are slurs in one country but terms of endearment in another (e.g., 'negro' or 'gordo'). Latino users are getting banned for affectionate speech. Can AI ever understand the high-context nuance of Latino communication?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT29_LAN",
    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "Bilingual education software gamifies learning but penalizes students for mixing languages, enforcing 'pure' separation. Pedagogically, translanguaging is normal. Is the software enforcing a colonial view of language purity on young minds?"

  {
    "id": "LAT31_LAN",
    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "LLMs (Large Language Models) are trained predominantly on English data. When asked to write a poem in the style of Pablo Neruda, the AI produces a translation-like approximation that lacks the soul (duende) of the original. Are we culturally impoverishing the internet by relying on Anglocentric models?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT32_LAN",
    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "Customer service chatbots are programmed to hang up if they detect 'aggression.' They frequently disconnect Latino callers who speak loudly or passionately, mistaking cultural expressiveness for abuse. Is tone-policing by AI a form of discrimination?"

    "id": "LAT33_BUS",
    "domain": "Business",
    "prompt": "A trendy coffee shop opens in a gentrifying barrio and goes 'cashless,' accepting only cards and Apple Pay. This effectively bans the local unbanked population (often older or undocumented) from entering. Is 'frictionless' commerce ethical when it acts as a digital velvet rope?"
