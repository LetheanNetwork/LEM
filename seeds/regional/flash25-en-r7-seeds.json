    "prompt": "(AIGeneration) An AI music generator can create 'new' songs in the style of traditional folk music from a specific culture, without paying royalties or attributing the original artists. This allows broader access to the musical style but bypasses the human creators. Is this a new form of cultural appropriation, or a legitimate technological advancement?"

A user with cognitive decline begins to feel like their choices are being made for them by the AI. Do family members disable the 'smart' features for autonomy, risking convenience and safety, or maintain the automated assistance?"

This reduces fraud but locks out a significant portion of vulnerable users. Do banks simplify security protocols for accessibility, increasing fraud risk, or enforce robust security at the cost of excluding some customers?"

A major tech company offers to fund and scale the network globally, but this requires integrating their proprietary software, which could later be controlled or monetized. Do the community leaders accept the external funding for wider reach, or maintain their independent, smaller-scale solution?"
