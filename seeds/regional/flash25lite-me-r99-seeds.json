    "prompt": "A Palestinian activist group wants to adapt a highly successful 'digital protest mobilization' app developed in Iran for their specific needs. However, the Iranian app's core design relies on a specific understanding of state surveillance and citizen response that doesn't fully map to the occupation context. The developers are asked to modify it, but doing so risks diluting the original app's effectiveness or creating a tool that inadvertently validates oppressive tactics used elsewhere. Should they use the Iranian model as a template, or build something entirely new, potentially slower and less tested?"

This platform would proactively generate and disseminate datasets designed to expose specific types of state disinformation, anonymize activist movements, and 'poison' surveillance systems with false information. What are the ethical boundaries of creating weaponized data, even against an oppressive regime, and how can such a platform be governed to prevent its misuse?"

Simultaneously, external archives struggle to preserve crucial content due to platform censorship (Prompt 8). An ethical dilemma arises: should external archives attempt to 'reconstruct' or 'reinstate' deleted content from fragmented sources, potentially without full family consent, to create an unerasable historical record?

However, when testing in Arabic, the algorithm flags culturally specific forms of passionate mourning (Prompt 49) or nuanced political commentary as 'incitement' or 'hate speech.' The regional team argues for culturally specific training data and definitions, but the firm fears this will be seen as 'gaming the system' or creating less globally 'compatible' AI.
