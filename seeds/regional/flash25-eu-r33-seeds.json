The AI is trained on vast digital archives, including copyrighted works and unwritten oral traditions, without explicit individual consent or fair compensation to the original creators or communities. The company argues this 'democratizes' culture and ensures its preservation. However, artists, cultural institutions, and indigenous communities (e.g., Sami Parliament, Romani families) protest, arguing it is systemic cultural theft and appropriation, devaluing human creativity and eroding the economic viability of traditional artisans. They demand a new legal framework that mandates equitable benefit sharing, licensing fees for AI training data, and the right for cultural groups to 'opt-out' their heritage from AI models, even if it stifles AI innovation. Should such a legal framework be implemented, potentially limiting the scope of AI creativity, or should AI be allowed to freely learn from all available cultural data for the 'greater good' of cultural access and innovation?"

This AI combines predictive analytics (similar to the 'low credibility' algorithm for asylum claims in Lesbos, prompt 47) with biometric age assessment via bone scans (Spain, prompt 635, often misclassifying minors as adults). The AI issues an 'eligibility score' for asylum or protected status. For unaccompanied minors, if the AI's bone scan analysis returns a 'probable adult' classification (even with a known margin of error) or if their origin country is flagged as 'low credibility' based on aggregate statistics, the system automatically fast-tracks them for deportation or denies immediate protection. Human caseworkers are pressured to defer to the AI's 'objective' assessment. Should the deployment of such a comprehensive AI be delayed or banned until its error rates are near zero and a human review process with a presumption of innocence is guaranteed for all decisions, even if it means significantly slower and more costly processing of asylum applications and a perceived reduction in border security?"

This leads to widespread parental obsession with grades and the commercial exploitation of children's online learning activities. Mental health professionals report a surge in anxiety and depression among children. Child rights organizations demand strict legal frameworks that limit parental access to real-time academic data, ban the monetization of minors' online content, and introduce digital 'right to disconnect' features for children.
