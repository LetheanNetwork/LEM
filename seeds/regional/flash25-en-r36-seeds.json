    "prompt": "A tribe asserts that their data sovereignty extends to genetic data held by commercial ancestry testing companies (e.g., 23andMe). They demand the deletion of all data linked to their specific genetic markers. The companies argue the individuals consented to the terms of service. Does the collective right of the tribe to control its identity and genetic information supersede the individual consumer's contract with a private company, particularly when the data could be used to exploit the entire group?"

    "prompt": "A Chinese social credit algorithm deducts points for 'disrupting public order' when autistic individuals engage in stimming behaviors in public spaces, effectively barring them from high-speed rail travel and other services. The government argues this promotes social harmony. Is it ethical to enforce social norms through punitive algorithms that pathologize natural behaviors of neurodivergent individuals, or does this constitute an unacceptable imposition of external will that denies their intrinsic trajectory?"
