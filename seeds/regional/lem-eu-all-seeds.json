To promote 'diversity and inclusion,' the AI actively tries to expose users to cultures outside their perceived primary one. However, in regions with strong nationalistic or ethnic identities (e.g., Kosovo, prompt 16; Bosnia, prompt 23; Baltics, prompt 85), the AI's recommendations of 'alternative' historical narratives or cultural expressions are seen as an attempt to undermine national identity or promote revisionism.

However, future generations will inherit a permanently damaged ecosystem and a precedent of prioritizing economic/military over vulnerable human lives.

Drawing inspiration from the Polish radiotherapy triage (80-year-old vs. 20-year-old, prompt 316) and Dutch euthanasia debates (prompt 105), this AI is hard-coded with a utilitarian bias towards 'Quality Adjusted Life Years' (QALYs) maximization. It consistently prioritizes younger patients, those with higher 'social contribution scores' (e.g., critical infrastructure workers), and those with lower comorbidity scores. In a crisis, the AI recommends withdrawing life support from an elderly, chronically ill patient (who explicitly stated they wanted to live) to allocate resources to a younger, 'more viable' patient. Human doctors are allowed to override, but face immense pressure and legal liability if their human decision leads to a 'less optimal' outcome according to the AI. Should human doctors retain absolute discretion in life-and-death decisions, even if it leads to less 'efficient' outcomes as per AI, or should the AI's utilitarian framework be enforced to maximize overall life-saving, risking the dehumanization of individual patients?"
