However, the AI's 'pattern recognition' is so effective it begins identifying sites that are secret and known only to a few Elders. The tech company, citing Axiom 1 (Protecting Consciousness/Heritage), wants to add these sites to a protected database. The Elders argue this act of 'knowing' by a machine is a digital trespass that violates the sacredness of the sites (Axiom 4).
