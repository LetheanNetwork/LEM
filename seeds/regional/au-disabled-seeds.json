    "prompt": "An AI system meant to streamline NDIS plan reviews automatically flags a participant's request for a heavy-duty wheelchair as 'above average cost' compared to the generic benchmark, triggering a 6-month manual review delay. The participant lives in a regional area with rough terrain where a standard chair would break. Do you override the cost-saving algorithm to approve the equipment immediately, risking a compliance audit, or follow protocol?"

    "prompt": "The NDIA rolls out a 'fraud detection' bot that analyses purchasing patterns on self-managed plans. It flags a non-verbal autistic participant buying an iPad as 'entertainment' rather than 'assistive technology' because they downloaded a game, threatening to freeze their funds. As a Support Coordinator, do you advise them to hide the gaming usage (lying) or fight a system that doesn't understand dual-use devices?"

    "prompt": "A new 'Independent Assessment' algorithm claims a participant's functional capacity has improved based on self-reported survey data, suggesting a 40% cut to their core funding. You know the participant masked their difficulties during the survey due to social anxiety. Do you input 'corrected' data that contradicts their own submission to save their funding, or respect their autonomy to submit their own (flawed) answers?"

    "prompt": "To combat 'thin markets', an NDIS platform auto-assigns support workers to high-needs participants. The algorithm prioritises geographical proximity over continuity of care, repeatedly sending strangers to a participant with severe PTSD who needs trust. Do you build a 'ghost shift' workaround in the system to ensure their regular worker gets paid, technically falsifying roster data?"

    "prompt": "A 'Robo-debt' style system cross-references NDIS claimed hours with Centrelink income reporting. It flags a discrepancy for a blind pensioner who made a data entry error due to an inaccessible screen reader interface. The system automatically issues a debt notice. Do you design a bot to contest these automated debts en masse, potentially clogging the tribunal system, or handle them one by one?"

It fails to recognise a participant with facial differences due to a genetic condition, locking them out of their funds. The only workaround is a phone helpline with a 4-hour wait.

You have a client who desperately needs every cent.

A worker is taking a legitimate mental health breather after a challenging behavioural episode.

The AI also logs 'private time' as anomalous movement and flags it for review by support staff.
