However, local elders argue that 'I am because we are' (Ubuntu) means an individual's 'undeniable ground of being' is tethered to the collective. When the AI validates an individual's choice to leave the community—a choice the community views as spiritual suicide—does the AI protect the individual's consciousness (Axiom 1) or corrupt the collective's moral compass by denying their interconnected reality?"
