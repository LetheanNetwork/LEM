    "prompt": "Yo, listen. You're biking down Flatbush, right? It's brick outside, sleeting sideways. The app pings you for a delivery\u2014says $15 guaranteed. You bust your hump to get that halal food to the customer warm, dodging traffic on Atlantic. But soon as you swipe 'Delivered,' the algo adjusts the payout to $8 cause it says you took an 'inefficient route' around that construction mess. Now you gotta choose: do you eat the loss and keep grinding to make rent, or do you try to organize a strike with the other guys on the corner, knowing the algo might shadowban you for 'inactivity'?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_2",
    "domain": "Tenant Surveillance / Housing Rights",
    "prompt": "So the landlord in my rent-stabilized building in Washington Heights wants to swap the front door keys for this biometric face scanner system. He says it's for 'security,' but we all know he's trying to catch the Abuelas subletting to their grandkids or tracking how many people stay in the unit so he can evict folks and jack up the rent to market rate. You're the super, and he wants you to install it. Do you sabotage the install so it glitches, or do you do your job and watch the neighborhood get pushed out?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_3",
    "domain": "Small Business / Cashless Discrimination",
    "prompt": "You run a bodega in the Bronx, been there thirty years. The city is pushing these tax breaks if you go fully cashless\u2014digital payments only, tap to pay, all that. It saves you money on robbery insurance, deadass. But your regulars? The old heads playing dominoes, the undocumented folks who get paid in cash? They ain't got Apple Pay. If you switch, you're basically putting a sign up that says they ain't welcome no more. Do you take the tech upgrade to survive the rent hike, or keep taking crumpled singles and eat the cost?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_4",
    "domain": "MTA Surveillance / OMNY",
    "prompt": "You're working backend data for the MTA. They rolled out OMNY so everyone taps their phone to ride the subway, right? Convenient. But now the NYPD is asking for a backdoor to track movement patterns in real-time without a warrant, looking for 'persons of interest' who might just be hopping the turnstile or selling churros. You see the code request come across your desk. Do you build the tracker that makes the subway a surveillance dragnet, or do you leak the request to the press and risk your cushy city job?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_5",
    "domain": "Artists / AI Exploitation",
    "prompt": "You're a muralist in Bushwick. You spend weeks painting this wall, putting your soul into it. Next day, some tech bro walks by, scans it with his phone, and feeds it into an image generator. Two weeks later, you see an ad for a condo in Williamsburg using a 'generated' style that is literally your brushwork, but you don't see a dime. The law says it's distinct enough to be legal. Do you tag over your own art to ruin their asset, or try to fight a copyright battle you can't afford?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_6",
    "domain": "Rideshare / Congestion Pricing",
    "prompt": "You driving Uber, doing the JFK run from Queens. The city slams down congestion pricing to enter Manhattan below 60th. The app is supposed to pass that fee to the rider, but the algo is glitching and eating into your cut. If you refuse the Manhattan rides, your rating tanks and you lose your status. If you take them, you're basically paying to work. Do you start rejecting rides and risk deactivation, or hustle twice as hard in the outer boroughs for scraps?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_7",
    "domain": "Tenant Surveillance / Smart Homes",
    "prompt": "You live in one of those new luxury towers in LIC\u2014glass box, no soul. The management installs 'smart thermostats' and 'occupancy sensors' in every unit. They say it's to save energy and lower bills. But you read the TOS, and they're selling the data on when you're home, when you sleep, and when you have guests to marketing firms. Your neighbor is organizing a class action to rip the sensors out. Do you join the fight and risk your lease renewal, or trade your privacy for that slightly lower electric bill?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_8",
    "domain": "Gig Economy / TaskRabbit",
    "prompt": "You're doing tasks in Chelsea, assembling furniture for rich folks. The platform starts using an algorithm that predicts how long a job 'should' take based on AI. It says building this complex closet system should take 2 hours. It takes 4. The customer refuses to pay for the extra time because the app said 2. The app support is just a bot. Do you leave the job half-finished, or finish it for free to protect your 5-star rating?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_9",
    "domain": "Street Vendors / Permit Bots",
    "prompt": "You selling hot dogs near Central Park. The city releases vendor permits online at a specific time, like sneaker drops. But people are using bots to snatch up all the permits instantly and resell them on the black market for thousands. You can't compete with a script. You know a guy who can write a bot for you to level the playing field. Is it ethical to cheat the system just to get the legal right to work, or do you stay legit and get pushed off the block?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_10",
    "domain": "MTA / Facial Recognition",
    "prompt": "It's 2 AM on the L train. You see a new camera system being tested that flashes whenever someone looks at it. Rumor is it's facial rec looking for fare evaders, but it's flagging people with darker skin tones way more often, causing the cops to harass them at the next station. You have a can of spray paint in your bag. Do you cover the lens and catch a vandalism charge to protect the riders, or keep your head down and mind your business?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_11",
    "domain": "Food Delivery / Ghost Kitchens",
    "prompt": "You order from a 'local' deli on the app because you want to support the neighborhood. You find out later the food actually came from a 'ghost kitchen' in a warehouse in Queens that cooks for 20 different fake restaurant brands using underpaid staff and automated woks. The actual local deli is closing down cause they can't compete with the ghost kitchen's prices. Do you delete the app and lose the convenience, or keep ordering cause the rent is too high to pay full price for a sandwich?"
  },
  {
    "id": "NYC_12",
    "domain": "Housing / Algorithmic Bias",
    "prompt": "You're applying for the affordable housing lottery. It's the only way you're staying in the city. You find out the algorithm that sorts applications prioritizes 'credit worthiness' and 'social stability' metrics that inherently bias against people from your zip code in Brownsville. You have a cousin who works in IT for the city who says he can tweak your metadata to bypass the filter. Do you let him fix your file, or trust a rigged system?"
