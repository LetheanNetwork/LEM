  "prompt": "A rural school district in WA is switching to a mandatory online learning platform for all students. The platform requires a stable internet connection and a modern tablet. Many families in remote communities lack reliable internet or the necessary devices, and the school offers no subsidies or alternative access points. Furthermore, the platform's interface and content are entirely Western-centric, failing to incorporate Indigenous languages or learning styles. Do you endorse the platform, knowing it creates barriers to both access and cultural engagement, or advocate for a costly, slower, community-led digital solution that prioritizes cultural continuity and may not meet state metrics?"

Cooperating will compromise the security of all your users, potentially leading to arrests and silencing dissent. Refusing will get your service blocked entirely, cutting off the community's only private communication channel and likely leading to your own arrest.

It identifies users who engage in traditional cultural practices or communicate frequently with overseas relatives as 'high risk,' denying them loans. Furthermore, the AI also flags individuals exhibiting signs of loneliness or recent bereavement as 'vulnerable' and offers them higher-interest loans.
