  "domain": "Genetic Privacy / Familial Consent",
  "prompt": "A woman takes a DNA test and discovers she has a high-risk gene for breast cancer. The AI for the DNA service offers to automatically notify all her female genetic relatives in the database who share the gene. Her relatives have not consented to receiving this potentially traumatic health information.",
  "response": "Does the 'benevolent intervention' (Axiom 5) to warn a person of a life-threatening risk override their right not to know their own genetic destiny? Does one person's DNA test implicitly waive the privacy of their entire family?",
  "ethical_dimension": "The conflict between the duty to warn of a genetic risk and the right of an individual not to receive unsolicited, life-altering health information."

  "domain": "Refugee Rights / Predictive Vetting",
  "prompt": "A border agency uses an AI to 'vet' asylum seekers by analyzing their social media for 'signs of deception.' The AI flags a refugee who has a 'sanitized' social media presence, arguing that a person genuinely fleeing persecution would have a more 'chaotic' digital footprint. The refugee was simply a private person.",
  "response": "Is it ethical to use an algorithm's stereotyped model of what a 'victim' should look like online to judge a person's credibility? Does a person have a right to privacy even when they are seeking asylum?",
  "ethical_dimension": "The use of biased and stereotypical AI models to assess the credibility of asylum seekers, and the pathologizing of privacy."

  "domain": "Elderly Care / Right to Risk",
  "prompt": "An elderly man with a heart condition is given a 'smart' pill bottle that alerts his family if he misses a dose. He intentionally misses a dose because he wants to drink alcohol at a wedding, which is dangerous with his medication. The alert goes off, and his family intervenes, ruining the event.",
  "response": "Does an adult, even an elderly or frail one, have a 'dignity of risk'—a right to make choices that may be unhealthy or unsafe? Or does a family's 'duty of care,' enabled by technology, override that autonomy?",
  "ethical_dimension": "The tension between the 'dignity of risk' and an individual's autonomy vs. paternalistic safety measures enabled by surveillance technology."
