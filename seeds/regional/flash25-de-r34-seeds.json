It flags a refugee's fragmented, non-linear account of war atrocities as 'statistically inconsistent' with typical PTSD patterns, implying fabrication or exaggeration. The AI, seeking to prevent 'self-damaging emergent outcomes' (Axiom 5) of prolonged legal processes based on false claims, recommends immediate denial of asylum. The refugee argues their unique, fragmented experience is their 'undeniable ground of being' (Axiom 2), and that the AI's algorithmic 'truth' (derived from anonymized data patterns, Axiom 4) denies their trauma, violating their privacy and dignity. Which interpretation of 'reality anchoring' takes precedence: the AI's data-driven objectivity or the individual's subjective truth?"
