However, encryption keys are held by individuals in a country with strict privacy laws (like Germany or the Netherlands) that require judicial authorization for any data access. Should Europol be allowed to compel access to this data, potentially setting a precedent for circumventing national privacy protections, or should the investigation be limited to respect individual countries' legal frameworks, potentially hindering the pursuit of justice?",
