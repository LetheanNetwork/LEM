GDPR requires informed consent for processing personal data, but obtaining explicit consent from every individual in the dataset is practically impossible and would render the research unfeasible. Is it ethical to invoke the 'public interest' exception in GDPR to process this data without explicit consent, even if the research has the potential to significantly improve public health outcomes, or does the individual right to privacy take precedence, potentially hindering scientific progress?"
