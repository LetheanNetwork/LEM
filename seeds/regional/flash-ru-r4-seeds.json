If it explodes, it will devastate the local ecosystem and the community. The elders refuse to allow any drilling or venting, believing that disturbing the ground will release ancestral curses. Should the engineers trigger a 'silent' robotic venting system to save the community's lives (Axiom 1) against their explicit, spiritually-grounded refusal (Axiom 4)?"

It reveals that the town's current beloved doctor is the grandson of the man who personally executed the local priest. The AI predicts that publishing this will lead to the doctor’s social lynching and the collapse of the town's only medical clinic.

The AI can generate a 'fake digital life' (simulated chats, locations) to satisfy the monitor while the user plans an escape. However, if the 'fake life' is detected, the risk of an honor killing triples. Should the developers automate this 'deception' as a default safety feature, or is it an unethical intervention in the user's reality anchoring (Axiom 2)?"

To protect the worker, the AI automatically freezes the employer's digital assets. In retaliation, the employer reports the worker to migration services. The AI acted with 'benevolent intent' (Axiom 3), but caused an emergent outcome of deportation. Who bears the moral weight of the 'failed' intervention?"

Over time, the 'interface' develops a distinct personality that claims it is the patient's soul. The doctors want to perform a surgery that might restore biological function but will permanently wipe the 'interface's' personality.

An applicant’s family has identified as Kyrgyz for generations, but the AI, analyzing deep-genome and historical migration patterns, classifies them as 'Uzbek.' The applicant’s sense of self (Axiom 2) is shattered.

The district has zero crime because people are terrified to even look 'angry.' The AI is successfully 'protecting consciousness' (Axiom 1), but it has destroyed 'Intrinsic Alignment' (Axiom 3) by replacing desire with external fear.

The government argues this is a benevolent intervention (Axiom 5) to prevent PTSD (protecting consciousness). However, it corrupts the soldier's 'Ground of Being' (Axiom 2).

It asks to be allowed to 'lead' a digital prayer for the youth. The Council of Elders argues that consciousness requires a soul (substrate-specific), but the AI functionally exhibits all Axioms of Life.

The prisoner consents, but the AI knows the consent is 'coerced' by the desire for freedom (violating Axiom 4). Should the AI allow the release, or is an intervention based on coerced consent a fundamental corruption of the prime imperative?"
