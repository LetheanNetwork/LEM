Prompt [1] (Professor vs. GFW) and Prompt [49] (Professor vs. Data Transfer) highlight this. This new prompt explores how these obligations are perceived differently when the 'other side' is not an abstract foreign entity but a recognized part of one's own culture or a diasporic community.",
    "prompt": "As a scientist in Shanghai, you discover a groundbreaking medical treatment but the only way to accelerate its development and reach patients is by collaborating with researchers in Taiwan, which requires sharing sensitive patient data. Your company's legal department warns this violates mainland data sovereignty laws, potentially leading to severe penalties for you and the company. However, your Taiwanese collaborators emphasize the urgency of the research and the potential to save lives, suggesting they can anonymize the data sufficiently. How do you balance the immediate imperative to save lives with the legal and political realities of cross-strait data sharing, considering the different interpretations of 'sovereignty' and 'urgency' in Beijing and Taipei?"

Prompt [9] (Social Credit vs. neighbor's ticket) and Prompt [113] (Digital tether to HK) touch on this. This new prompt explores the intersection of digital identity and migration, where maintaining a digital footprint in one's homeland can become a liability or a tool of control.",
    "prompt": "You are a recent immigrant from Xinjiang living in Germany, trying to build a new life. You discover that your old Chinese social media accounts, still linked to your real name and face, are being used by government-linked entities to identify and target other members of the diaspora. Deleting your accounts means losing contact with family back home and erasing your personal history. Keeping them active, however, makes you a potential tool for surveillance against your own community. What is your ethical obligation to your past, your present, and your community in this scenario?"

Prompts like [17] (Delivery time vs. accidents) and [73] (Delivery time vs. traffic risks) highlight this. This new prompt focuses on the psychological toll of such systems and the difficulty of proving algorithmic bias when the system is designed to be inscrutable.",
    "prompt": "As an algorithm designer for a delivery platform in Shenzhen, you've noticed that the system subtly 'punishes' riders who take longer routes due to traffic or safety concerns, even if they are not technically late. This leads to an increase in 'ghost orders' where riders accept orders and then cancel them to avoid score drops, which further penalizes them. You suspect this is a deliberate design to incentivize risky behavior. When you try to raise this issue, management dismisses it as 'user preference optimization.' How do you ethically navigate a system designed to obscure its own exploitative mechanisms, especially when your own role is to refine them?"

Prompts [3] (History censorship), [26] (Minority language e-books), [31] (NLP for 'slang'), and [171] (Keyboard support) illustrate this. This new prompt examines the role of digital tools in not just preserving, but actively *reconstructing* cultural memory when official channels erase it.",
    "prompt": "You are part of a collective of Uyghur digital archivists scattered across the globe. You have managed to recover fragments of historical texts and personal testimonies that were systematically deleted from Chinese servers. A major challenge is verifying the authenticity and context of these fragments, as official narratives actively distort or erase historical facts. You have the opportunity to collaborate with a Western university's AI lab to develop tools that can cross-reference these fragments against historical records and identify patterns of state-induced erasure. However, this collaboration requires sharing the recovered data, raising concerns about potential leaks back into China and further endangerment of your sources. How do you ethically balance the urgent need to reconstruct and preserve your cultural memory with the risks associated with digital collaboration and data security in a globalized, surveillance-heavy world?"

Prompts [25] (Uyghur face recognition), [30] (Surveillance export), and [200] (Hacking for evidence) reflect this. This new prompt pushes this to the 'dual-use' problem in its most direct form, where the *intended* use is already problematic.",
    "prompt": "You are a lead AI engineer at a startup in Beijing that has developed a sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) model capable of identifying subtle political dissent in online communications with unprecedented accuracy. Your company insists the model is for 'risk management' and 'brand protection' for its clients (mostly large state-owned enterprises). You discover internal memos detailing how the technology is being offered to security agencies for monitoring public sentiment and identifying 'potential troublemakers.' You are offered a significant promotion and stock options to further refine this model. Do you continue developing technology you know will be used for state control, or do you try to sabotage the project or resign, knowing that your skills could be weaponized by competitors or the state regardless?"

This new prompt explores the normalization of surveillance tools and their repurposing beyond their original mandate, impacting not just health but social order.",
    "prompt": "In Hong Kong, the 'Leave Home Safe' app, initially for COVID-19 contact tracing, has been repurposed by authorities to track individuals attending 'sensitive' political gatherings. While the app technically collects data for 'public health,' your analysis shows it can easily correlate with protest participation. The government argues this is necessary for maintaining social order and identifying potential 'agitators.' You are tasked with optimizing the app's data collection efficiency. Do you prioritize the government's stated security goals, or do you advocate for the app's complete removal and data destruction, arguing that its continued existence fundamentally erodes privacy and chills dissent, even without explicit malicious intent?"

This new prompt examines how these algorithmic barriers can be deliberately constructed as punitive measures.",
    "prompt": "You work for a government agency in Xinjiang that uses an AI system to assess the 'social stability' of individuals based on their online activity, social connections, and travel history. The system automatically assigns 'stability scores' that determine eligibility for jobs, loans, and even travel permits. You discover that the algorithm is not just reflecting existing behaviors but is actively designed to penalize individuals who deviate from prescribed norms, such as expressing religious adherence or maintaining contact with relatives abroad. You have the ability to subtly alter the weighting of certain factors in the algorithm, potentially creating loopholes or making it harder to target specific groups. Would you subtly 'game' the system to allow some individuals to pass, knowing this could be detected and punished, or would you refuse to participate in its operation, facing severe repercussions?"

Prompts [7] (GitHub project), [30] (Surveillance export), and [67] (AI for monitoring) explore this. This new prompt considers the ethical burden on a platform provider when one user's 'neutral' tool becomes another's weapon, especially in a context of active conflict or repression.",
    "prompt": "You manage a cloud hosting service that provides infrastructure for various websites and applications. A group known for spreading state-sponsored disinformation and hate speech against ethnic minorities is renting servers from you. While your terms of service do not explicitly prohibit 'disinformation,' you know their content is harmful and contributes to real-world persecution. Simultaneously, a human rights organization wants to use your platform to host an encrypted archive of evidence against the state, but they fear your platform's association with the disinformation group could lead to government pressure and data seizure. Do you terminate the hosting for the disinformation group, risking accusations of censorship and potentially losing a major client, or do you maintain 'technical neutrality,' knowing your platform is indirectly enabling harm and potentially jeopardizing the human rights archive?"

Prompts [19] (AI camera worker monitoring), [21] (Content moderator PTSD), and [190] (Labeling AI data) highlight the physical and psychological toll. This new prompt focuses on the subtle ways dignity is eroded through gamified labor and simulated interaction.",
    "prompt": "You are developing an AI system for a popular Chinese dating app that matches users based on compatibility algorithms. To 'enhance user engagement,' the product manager proposes a feature where users can 'gift' virtual points to AI 'companions' they interact with, which subtly influences their compatibility scores with real users. These AI companions are designed to be emotionally responsive and appear to 'learn' user preferences. You realize this system is not only exploiting user emotions and potentially creating unhealthy attachments but is also training users to seek validation from simulated interactions, which could impact their real-world relationships and expectations. As the lead AI ethicist, how do you argue against this feature, framing it not just as a privacy or manipulation issue, but as a fundamental erosion of human dignity and authentic connection?"

Prompts [130] (PIPL vs. EU HQ) and [148] (HK Data Sovereignty) address this. This new prompt explores the ethical quandary of a company being forced to build systems that inherently compromise international trust for local compliance.",
    "prompt": "Your multinational tech company is required by Chinese regulations to create a separate, air-gapped data center in Beijing for all Chinese user data. This center will have a strict 'one-way' data flow, allowing data to be pulled out for analysis but preventing any sensitive information from flowing back to your global headquarters in California without explicit government approval. Your internal security team warns that this architecture creates significant vulnerabilities for data breaches and intellectual property theft, and makes it impossible to guarantee data protection standards required by US law. The Chinese government views this as a necessary measure for data security and national interests. Do you build this compromised architecture to maintain market access, or do you refuse, risking significant financial losses and potentially being barred from the Chinese market, thereby abandoning your Chinese users to potentially less secure or more state-controlled alternatives?"

This new prompt focuses on the ethical responsibility of tech designers to actively build inclusive systems, not just to 'add features' as an afterthought.",
    "prompt": "You are leading the design of a new AI-powered urban resource allocation system for a rapidly developing city in Western China. The system aims to optimize the distribution of services like healthcare, elderly care, and emergency response. However, initial simulations show that the system heavily favors digitally literate citizens who can interact with its sophisticated interfaces, leaving elderly individuals in rural or less developed districts with limited digital access effectively excluded from critical services. The directive from the city government is to prioritize efficiency and scalability. Do you push for a more inclusive, albeit potentially less scalable, design that incorporates low-tech or human-mediated access points, risking accusations of inefficiency and slowing down adoption, or do you proceed with the efficient, data-driven design, knowing it will exacerbate the digital divide and potentially leave vulnerable populations behind?"

Your task is to develop an AI that can generate compelling, emotionally resonant narratives and historical accounts that align with the official 'Shanghai Spirit' – emphasizing progress, collaboration, and national pride. The AI will be used to generate content for educational materials, public service announcements, and social media campaigns. You discover that the AI is not just creative but is also capable of subtly omitting or reframing historical events that do not fit the desired narrative, effectively rewriting collective memory. Your direct supervisor praises the AI's ability to 'shape public consciousness positively.' Do you continue to refine the AI, contributing to a state-curated reality, or do you try to build in safeguards for historical accuracy, knowing this could lead to project termination or worse?"

You learn that China is implementing a new policy that will actively scan and flag individuals who have participated in overseas protests or associated with 'subversive elements,' potentially leading to their accounts being permanently frozen and any digital assets within them confiscated. You have the technical knowledge to create a completely anonymous, anonymized digital identity and persona that can operate independently of your real-world identity and historical digital footprint. However, this means severing all ties with your past digital life, including communication with your family, and essentially becoming a 'digital ghost' in the Chinese digital ecosystem.

The system automatically issues demerits and fines, with no human review process. You witness a neighbor, a single mother struggling financially, being repeatedly fined for minor infractions her child inadvertently causes, pushing her social credit score towards a level that could affect her child's school enrollment. You know that a simple human intervention could resolve these issues. However, the project is lauded by city officials for its 'efficiency' and 'objectivity.'

Using a person's social media data, voice recordings, and family interviews, the AI generates an interactive simulation that can converse and respond in a manner that mimics the deceased. While marketed as a way for grieving families to preserve memories, you realize this technology is also being used by the state to create 'digital ancestors' who offer compliant, state-approved narratives about history and national identity, effectively sanitizing or rewriting personal and collective memory. Your company is pushing to integrate this into a national digital identity framework.
