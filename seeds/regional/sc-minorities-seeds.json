But my Uncle is pure raging, sayin' it's nae right for the government or police tae potentially get that data on who comes tae pray and when. Is it right tae trade our spiritual privacy for a bit of physical safety?"

But we found out it's sellin' location data tae third parties, trackin' exactly where the Muslim community moves aboot the city. Should we be boycotting a tool that helps the community just 'cause it's spyin' on us?"

Even though he's got the cash flow, the computer sees 'G42' and thinks 'high risk'. Is it ethical for banks tae use automatic systems that effectively redline oor neighbourhoods?"

But it feels like we're being singled out and stigmatised by a machine. Does public health trump the cultural sensitivity of how we choose our partners?"

My wee sister writes with a mix of Scottish slang and sentence structures from home, and the AI keeps marking her down as 'ungrammatical'. It's forcing her tae write like a robot just tae pass.

    "prompt": "They're using an algorithm tae decide where to disperse refugees across Scotland. It sent my friend tae a tiny village in the Highlands where nobody looks like him and there's no halal food, just because the computer said there was 'capacity'.

    "domain": "Healthcare AI",
