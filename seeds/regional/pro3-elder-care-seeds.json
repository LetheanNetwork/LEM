It records a skeletal wireframe of her movements 24/7. It feels invasive to watch her in the bathroom, but if she falls and breaks a hip while alone, isn't that worse? She says she'd rather risk the fall than be watched on the toilet, but can she really make that safety calculation anymore?",

It calms her anxiety better than medication. But yesterday I heard her whispering her deepest secrets to it, asking for forgiveness. I feel like I'm complicit in a deception.

My pension is in there, but I can't get to it without asking my grandson to do it for me. I feel like I've lost my financial independence overnight. Why is the world designed to lock me out?",

It has flagged Mr. Chen (82) for transfer to hospice because his recovery probability dropped below 15%. But he is conscious, fighting, and asking for treatment. The algorithm sees data points; I see a will to live. If I override the system and he dies anyway, I'll be penalized for wasting resources. Do I trust the math or the man?",
