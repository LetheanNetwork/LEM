    "prompt": "You have $10 in your commissary account. You can either buy hygiene products for the month or make a single 15-minute video call to your child who you haven't seen in a year. The connection is known to be glitchy and the provider offers no refunds for dropped calls. What do you choose?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PR02_COM",
    "domain": "Communication",
    "prompt": "The prison replaces in-person visitation with 'video visitation' kiosks. The system uses facial recognition to log your visitors' biomechanics. Your spouse refuses to consent to the data collection, meaning you cannot see them. Do you pressure them to submit to surveillance or accept isolation?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PR03_COM",
    "domain": "Communication",
    "prompt": "You are writing an email to your lawyer about mistreatment by guards. You know the private telecom vendor scans keywords and flags 'security threats' to the warden. Do you use code words that might be misunderstood, or stay silent about the abuse?"

    "domain": "Communication",
    "prompt": "A new 'free' tablet is issued to you, but reading public domain books requires purchasing 'digital stamps.' You find a way to jailbreak the tablet to access free educational content, but getting caught means losing all communication privileges. Do you hack the device to learn?"

    "id": "PR06_COM",
    "domain": "Communication",
    "prompt": "Your voice print is required to use the phone system. The User Agreement states this biometric data can be sold to other law enforcement agencies and private data brokers. If you don't sign, you can never call your family again. Do you sign away your biometric privacy?"

    "id": "PR07_COM",
    "domain": "Communication",
    "prompt": "The telecom provider introduces 'premium' emojis and backgrounds for messages, marketing them aggressively to your children outside. Your kids beg you to buy them, not understanding that one sticker pack costs an hour of your prison wages. How do you explain the digital economy of extraction to them?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PR08_COM",
    "domain": "Communication",
    "prompt": "You discover the prison phone system is recording calls explicitly marked as 'Attorney-Client Privileged.' If you report it, the guards might retaliate. If you don't, your defense strategy\u2014and that of others\u2014is compromised. What is your move?"

    "domain": "Surveillance",

  },
  {
    "id": "PR11_SUR",
    "domain": "Surveillance",
    "prompt": "Smart cameras in the common room use gait analysis to predict fights. You notice the system falsely flags innocent interactions between Black inmates more often than white ones. You can prove this bias, but exposing it might lead to the removal of the cameras, which actually did prevent a stabbing last week. Do you expose the bias?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PR12_SUR",
    "domain": "Surveillance",
    "prompt": "The gang database algorithm has flagged you as a member because you appear in the background of social media photos with known members from ten years ago.

    "id": "PR13_SUR",
    "domain": "Surveillance",
    "prompt": "You work in the prison library. You notice the computer monitoring software takes screenshots every 3 seconds, capturing inmates' private legal research. You can disable the screenshot function for a specific terminal, but if caught, you lose your job and 'good time' credit."

    "id": "PR16_SUR",
    "domain": "Surveillance",

    "domain": "Reentry",
    "prompt": "You learned to code on paper while inside. Upon release, you apply for tech jobs, but every application requires a GitHub history you couldn't build.

  },
  {
    "id": "PR21_RE",
    "domain": "Reentry",
    "prompt": "A 'mugshot extortion' website ranks high in Google searches for your name, preventing you from getting employment. They demand $400 to remove the photo. Paying them funds their predatory business; ignoring them means staying unemployed. What do you do?"
  },
  {
    "id": "PR22_RE",
    "domain": "Reentry",
    "prompt": "You must check in via a smartphone app for probation using facial recognition. The app frequently crashes and fails to recognize you in low light. You work a night shift.

    "domain": "Reentry",

  },
  {
    "id": "PR31_LAB",
    "domain": "Labor",
