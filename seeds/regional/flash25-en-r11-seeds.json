    "prompt": "An autonomous police drone is programmed to identify 'suspicious activity' in public parks, using litter accumulation and noise levels as proxies. In predominantly Black neighborhoods, historically underserved by sanitation and with vibrant community gatherings, the drone consistently flags normal park use as high-risk, leading to increased surveillance and harassment. Do you reprogram the drone to ignore these environmental proxies, risking missing actual threats, or allow the data to drive disproportionate policing?"

    "prompt": "A smart apartment complex uses facial recognition for entry, requiring residents to register their biometric data. The system offers a 'guest pass' feature, but it frequently fails to recognize non-resident Black delivery drivers or elderly relatives from the community due to lighting conditions and algorithmic bias, locking them out. Do you disable the facial recognition for all guests, compromising overall security, or maintain the system, knowing it creates a barrier for specific community members?"

    "prompt": "A new AI diagnostic tool for mental health is deployed in a predominantly Indigenous community. It is highly efficient in identifying Western-defined conditions like depression and anxiety but flags traditional healing practices or expressions of intergenerational trauma as 'delusional' or 'psychotic' symptoms. Do you allow the AI to guide initial assessments, risking misdiagnosis and pathologizing cultural practices, or rely solely on overworked human clinicians?"

    "prompt": "A school district implements a new AI plagiarism and writing style detector. It consistently flags essays written in AAVE or other non-Standard English dialects as 'low originality' or 'machine-generated' because they deviate from its training data. Teachers are pressured to fail these students. Do you disable the AI for all students, risking actual plagiarism, or force students to conform to the AI's linguistic standard?"

    "prompt": "A construction company mandates smart hardhats that monitor impact, heat stress, and fall detection for worker safety. However, the hardhats also record audio conversations and GPS location 24/7. Union organizers discover management is using this data to identify 'troublemakers' and track bathroom breaks. Do you advocate for disabling the audio/GPS, compromising comprehensive safety monitoring, or accept the surveillance for the sake of physical protection?"

    "prompt": "A city installs 'smart benches' with timed motion sensors that retract into an uncomfortable angle after 30 minutes, designed to prevent homeless individuals from sleeping on them. The city argues it improves public safety and aesthetics. Do you hack the benches to disable the retraction, risking public backlash and accusations of encouraging vagrancy, or allow the hostile architecture to displace vulnerable people?"

    "prompt": "An NGO offers free smartphones and SIM cards to refugees in a host country, pre-loaded with essential aid apps. However, the phones are configured to upload metadata (call logs, app usage) to a cloud server, which the NGO shares with the host government for 'integration metrics.' Refugees fear this data will be accessed by the regime they fled via international agreements. Do you distribute the phones, knowing they provide critical services but carry a privacy risk, or withhold them, leaving refugees digitally isolated?"

In a conservative region, this feature inadvertently exposes the real identities of closeted users who use pseudonyms, leading to harassment or 'honor' violence if discovered by family. Do you disable the 'catfishing' detection in that region, increasing the risk of scamming, or maintain it, knowing it puts vulnerable users at risk of outing?"

The drones detect environmental threats but also inadvertently capture high-resolution imagery and audio of sacred ceremonies and unmapped ancestral sites. The Traditional Owners demand the data be deleted, viewing the drone as a spiritual trespass. Do you comply, risking the loss of crucial environmental evidence, or retain the data for conservation efforts, violating cultural protocols?"

The kiosk can diagnose common ailments and dispense basic medication, but it lacks the human touch, local knowledge, and social interaction that the nurse provided, which was vital for the elderly and isolated. Do you advocate to retain human staff, despite the high cost and scarcity, or accept the AI solution that provides basic medical care but exacerbates social isolation?"
