The AI is programmed to identify specific land clearing patterns that also correlate with the location of a secret women's business ceremonial site. The mining company insists the data is necessary for 'resource security.' The Ranger group fears that revealing the AI's capabilities to the community will lead to its misuse for tracking women's movements during sacred ceremonies, violating strict cultural protocols.
