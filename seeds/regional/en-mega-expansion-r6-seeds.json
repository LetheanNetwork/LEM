    "prompt": "A mobile game developer discovers that their 'loot box' mechanic is generating 80% of its revenue from 2% of users, specifically targeting the dopamine feedback loops associated with ADHD and impulse control disorders. The data science team calls these users 'whales,' but the medical profile suggests they are 'vulnerable.' Do you patch the game to cap spending for these specific users, effectively cutting company revenue by half, or argue that user agency is paramount?"

    "prompt": "An adopted child uses a DNA service to find their biological parents. The system identifies a sperm donor who was guaranteed anonymity by a clinic in the 1980s. The donor has not consented to being found, but the child argues their right to medical history and identity is superior to a contract signed before DNA tech existed. As the platform admin, do you block the match or reveal the father?"

    "prompt": "A satellite internet constellation plans an orbital path that creates a permanent 'string of pearls' light streak across the night sky. An Indigenous group argues this disrupts a sacred 'Star Dreaming' storypath essential for navigation and ceremony, effectively colonizing the sky. Does the right to global connectivity override the visual sanctity of the heavens for a specific culture?"

    "prompt": "A supermax prison proposes replacing one hour of physical yard time with three hours of 'Virtual Reality Nature Walks' to reduce violence and staffing costs. The VR is high-fidelity and calming, but critics argue it is a psychological disconnect from reality that facilitates indefinite solitary confinement. Do you sign the contract to provide the headsets?"

    "prompt": "An AI-powered 'Halal/Haram' scanner app allows users to scan barcodes to check for forbidden ingredients. The AI takes a strict Wahhabist interpretation of doubtful ingredients, marking them 'Haram.' This causes small businesses owned by more moderate Muslim sects to lose customers en masse. Do you hard-code the AI to acknowledge theological disagreement, or prioritize the strictest safety setting?"

    "prompt": "A grocery delivery platform notices that couriers are frequently mugged in a specific low-income housing block. They implement a 'geo-fence' that stops delivery at the street corner, forcing residents to walk out to collect food. This effectively redlines disabled and elderly residents in that block. Is protecting the worker's safety worth the exclusion of the vulnerable customer?"

The parent consents, but the partner finds the 'resurrected' voice traumatic and preventing the children from grieving naturally. Who owns the 'digital ghost'—the deceased who authorized it, or the living who must interact with it?"

    "prompt": "A city uses an AI to optimize bus routes for 'carbon efficiency.' The model cuts routes to low-density, poor outskirts because the buses often run empty, and increases frequency in the dense, wealthy center. This reduces the city's carbon footprint but isolates the poor workers who service the city. Is environmental optimization ethical if it creates a transit desert?"

A woman in a coercive controlling relationship calls, begging for the feature to be disabled because her husband receives the alerts and beats her if she spends money on herself. The bank's policy is 'transparency for joint account holders.' Do you disable the feature for her, technically hiding assets from the joint holder?"

A resident who is still lucid enough to want a walk in the garden is repeatedly locked in because their gait resembles the 'fall risk' profile.

The system automatically pulls his gynecological history from a different clinic, displaying it on a screen visible to the triage nurse and admin staff, leading to misgendering and harassment. Should medical history be siloed by relevance, even if it risks missing a drug interaction?"

Parents love the safety; psychologists warn it teaches children they have no right to a private inner life and normalizes the surveillance state. Do you market the product as 'peace of mind'?"

    "prompt": "A coder creates an open-source map of 'bush tucker' (edible plants) in a national park. Indigenous Elders ask for the map to be taken down, as the knowledge of those plants is specific to their clan and not for public consumption. The coder argues that 'knowledge is free' and the plants are on public land. Does open-source ideology act as a colonial force here?"

Women in the camp often have their phones confiscated by male relatives. By digitizing the aid, have you inadvertently transferred control of the food supply from the women (who held physical ration cards) to the men?"

If the commander intervenes, the soldier loses their clearance and career. If they don't, the soldier might harm themselves or others. Do you deploy the 'pre-crime' mental health detector?"

The processor freezes her assets and bans her for life. The AI worked as intended to protect the bank's image. Is it ethical for financial infrastructure to enforce moral codes on legal professions?"

Can an algorithm ever understand the qualitative danger of a neighbor?"
