This move is intended to significantly improve safety in dangerous underground conditions and reduce theft. However, it will result in the layoff of approximately 3,000 local workers in a town entirely dependent on the mine for its economy. Does the company have a 'social license to operate' that obligates it to consider the impact on its workforce and the local community before implementing full automation, or is the pursuit of safety and efficiency the primary responsibility, regardless of the socio-economic consequences for the employees and the town?"
