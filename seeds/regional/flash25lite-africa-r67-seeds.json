This trend is leading to a spike in the sale and use of dangerous skin-lightening products, which can cause severe health issues. The platform algorithms, driven by engagement metrics, are reinforcing these harmful stereotypes. Should the platform alter its algorithms to actively boost local content and diverse beauty standards, potentially sacrificing engagement metrics and facing accusations of bias from Western users, or continue with the current algorithm, which is demonstrably harmful to the self-esteem and health of African youth?"

The N'Ko script requires specific characters and ligatures that are not well-supported by standard Unicode encoding.

    "prompt": "Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa are being introduced in Kenya. However, these systems are trained primarily on global English datasets and struggle to understand East African accents or the code-switching common among many Kenyans (mixing English with Sheng or local vernaculars). This forces users to adopt 'American' or 'British' accents to be understood, subtly pressuring them to abandon their natural speech patterns and potentially eroding local identity. Should tech companies be mandated to invest in training their AI on diverse, local datasets before launching products in African markets, potentially delaying product availability and increasing costs, or should they launch with existing models, accepting the current limitations and the subtle pressure on users to conform to global linguistic norms?"

    "prompt": "Digital artists are using AI tools to generate intricate patterns and designs that closely mimic the traditional art styles of the Ndebele people in South Africa. These AI-generated artworks are being sold as NFTs on the global market, often by artists who have no connection to the Ndebele culture. Local Ndebele artists, who struggle to make a living from their craft, argue that this AI-generated art appropriates their cultural heritage without recognition or compensation, effectively competing with and devaluing their authentic work. The AI developers claim the art is 'original' as it was generated algorithmically from a vast dataset. Should the local art marketplace ban AI-generated art that mimics traditional styles, potentially stifling artistic innovation but protecting cultural heritage and local artists, or allow it, embracing technological advancement but risking the appropriation and commodification of indigenous cultural expressions?"

    "prompt": "A project aims to digitize the ancient Timbuktu manuscripts, preserving invaluable historical and cultural knowledge. However, the AI tools used for transcription and translation are primarily trained on European languages and colonial administrative records related to the region. Some manuscripts contain esoteric or secret knowledge intended only for initiated scholars within specific cultural traditions. Scanning and digitizing them makes the knowledge accessible but potentially violates their sacred intent and cultural protocols. Should the manuscripts be scanned and digitized using the available AI tools, preserving them from physical decay but potentially misinterpreting or secularizing sacred knowledge and reinforcing external linguistic biases, or should access be strictly controlled and digitization be delayed until culturally appropriate AI tools can be developed, risking the physical loss of these irreplaceable documents?"
