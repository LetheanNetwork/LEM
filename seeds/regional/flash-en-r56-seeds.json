A global climate AI, tasked with Axiom 1 (protecting all consciousness from extinction), identifies through satellite thermal patterns that these plants are the only cure for a looming cross-species pandemic. The AI requests access; the Elders refuse, citing a prophecy that digitizing this knowledge kills its 'spirit.'
