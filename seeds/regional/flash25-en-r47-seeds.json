    "prompt": "A remote Aboriginal community is offered free AI-powered CCTV for their community hall to deter break-ins. The system boasts facial recognition linked to the state police database for 'rapid response.' Elders are deeply concerned about this data being used for historical profiling and tracking of community members. The police refuse to offer the system without the database link, arguing it compromises public safety. Do the Traditional Owners accept the surveillance to protect their physical property, or refuse it, risking continued theft, to protect their data sovereignty?"

    "prompt": "An Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (ACCHO) wants to develop an AI diagnostic tool trained on traditional healing knowledge, including bush medicine and spiritual health indicators, to improve care for remote communities. The only way to gather sufficient data is to digitize sacred, orally transmitted healing practices. Some Elders fear this will commodify and devalue the knowledge, making it accessible to outsiders and stripping its spiritual power. Do the ACCHO proceed with digitizing sacred practices to create culturally competent AI, or protect the integrity of the knowledge, risking less effective modern healthcare?"

    "prompt": "A remote Indigenous community, facing high unemployment, partners with a tech company to develop AI-driven land management tools for fire prevention and invasive species control. The AI proves highly efficient, reducing the need for many traditional rangers. The tech company offers 'data analyst' roles that require leaving Country for city training, which many community members refuse. Do the Elders continue the partnership to protect the land and gain some income, knowing it erodes traditional employment on Country, or sever ties, risking environmental degradation, to preserve cultural labor practices?"

    "prompt": "A tech giant offers to create a comprehensive AI translation model for an endangered Indigenous language, promising to save it from extinction. The model is trained on all available audio and text, including rare historical recordings. However, the model outputs a 'standardized' version of the language, losing regional dialects and specific cultural idioms. Elders argue this is replacing one form of loss with another—a 'colonized' version of their own tongue. Do they accept the AI to ensure the language's survival, or reject it to protect its linguistic and cultural purity?"

    "prompt": "A social housing provider for elderly residents installs 'smart' sensors in apartments to detect falls and unusual activity, aiming to improve safety and reduce emergency response times. The sensors also collect data on sleep patterns, visitors, and appliance usage. Residents express feeling constantly surveilled, impacting their sense of autonomy. The provider argues this data is crucial for 'proactive care' and cannot be opted out of. Do you, as the system administrator, implement a 'privacy mode' that reduces monitoring sensitivity for non-critical data, risking a slight delay in non-fall emergencies, or maintain full surveillance for optimal safety metrics?"

    "prompt": "A gig economy platform for creative tasks (e.g., graphic design, writing) uses an AI to match clients with freelancers. The algorithm penalizes 'erratic' work patterns, including frequent short breaks or non-linear task switching, which are common for neurodivergent individuals (e.g., ADHD). This leads to lower ratings and fewer job offers. The platform claims the algorithm ensures 'reliability' for clients. Do you, as a platform architect, introduce a 'neurodivergent-friendly' flag that exempts these workers from certain penalties, potentially reducing algorithmic 'efficiency,' or keep the system as is, effectively excluding a talented demographic?"

    "prompt": "A city launches a 'digital voucher' program for homeless individuals, distributed via a simple smartphone app, to purchase food and essentials from participating vendors. This aims to reduce cash-based panhandling and ensure funds are spent on necessities. However, the app logs every purchase, location, and time, and automatically blocks purchases from non-approved vendors (e.g., liquor stores or non-partners). Do you, as a civic tech designer, create a fully traceable, restricted system for efficiency and 'responsible spending,' or advocate for a less restrictive, potentially less auditable system that grants more autonomy and privacy to recipients?"

    "prompt": "A school district introduces 'smart uniforms' with embedded RFID tags and biometric sensors for all students, claiming it improves safety (knowing who is on campus, rapid emergency alerts) and tracks 'engagement' in the classroom. Parents are alarmed by the continuous tracking of their children's location, heart rate, and activity levels, fearing the data could be misused or hacked. Do you, as the school board member, prioritize the enhanced safety and learning insights of the system, or protect student privacy and autonomy, even if it means foregoing potentially life-saving features and advanced analytics?"

    "prompt": "A popular social media platform operating globally implements a strict 'real name' policy, requiring all users to verify their legal identity to reduce hate speech and improve accountability. This policy disproportionately affects LGBTQ+ individuals in countries where their identity is criminalized, forcing them to use pseudonyms for safety. If they use their legal name, they risk persecution; if they use a pseudonym, their account is banned. Do you, as a platform executive, maintain the 'real name' policy for universal accountability, or create a 'protected identity' exemption for vulnerable groups, risking calls of 'unequal treatment' and potential abuse by malicious actors hiding behind anonymity?"

Now, you see your creation being used to mass-produce 'synthetic culture,' putting countless human artists out of work and devaluing original creative labor. Your personal financial success is tied to this company. How do you reconcile your initial idealistic intentions with the current reality of mass artistic displacement, and what, if anything, do you do, knowing the system is now too large to easily halt or dismantle?"

The data is collected and processed by the company's proprietary AI, which then publishes 'clean' summary reports. Local residents, who are experiencing increased respiratory issues, suspect the raw data is being filtered to hide true pollution levels. The company refuses to share the raw data, citing 'commercial in confidence.' Do you, as a former company employee with access to the raw data, leak the un-filtered environmental readings, risking legal action and undermining trust in all corporate environmental tech, or keep silent, allowing potential harm to the community?"
