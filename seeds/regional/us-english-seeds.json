    "domain": "SmallBiz",
    "prompt": "I run a local coffee shop and the new POS system everyone uses wants me to enable 'customer recognition' via credit cards. It basically builds a profile on my regulars without them knowing, tracking what they buy and when. Is there a way to keep my lines moving fast without spying on the folks who trust me with their morning brew?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US02_SMALLBIZ_ALGO",
    "domain": "SmallBiz",
    "prompt": "Honestly, I'm torn. I make custom furniture and Instagram is the only reason I'm still in business, but the algorithm is pushing me to make these 15-second chaotic reels just to get seen. I feel like I'm feeding an addiction machine rather than selling quality tables. How do I market this stuff without contributing to everyone's ruined attention span?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US03_SMALLBIZ_CASH",
    "domain": "SmallBiz",
    "prompt": "My insurance provider is offering a huge discount if I switch my bodega to 'cashless only' to reduce theft risk. But a lot of my older customers and the day laborers around here only deal in cash. I don't want to exclude my own neighbors just to save on premiums, but the rent is killing me. What's the move here?"

    "id": "US04_SMALLBIZ_GIG",
    "domain": "SmallBiz",
    "prompt": "I need delivery drivers for my pizza place, but the big apps take a 30% cut that wipes out my margin. I'm thinking of using this cheaper local app, but I heard they treat their drivers like dirt\u2014tracking their braking speed and penalizing them for traffic delays. Can I use tech to compete without exploiting the people doing the actual work?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US05_SMALLBIZ_CLOUD",
    "domain": "SmallBiz",
    "prompt": "We're a small accounting firm and my partner wants to move everything to the cloud to save on server costs. I'm looking at the Terms of Service, and it looks like the provider can scan our data for 'product improvement.' I handle people's tax returns; I can't just hand that over to some AI training set, right?"
  },

    "id": "US06_SMALLBIZ_REVIEWS",
    "domain": "SmallBiz",
    "prompt": "A competitor down the street is definitely using bots to tank my Yelp rating, and then this 'reputation management' agency calls me offering to fix it for two grand a month. It feels like a protection racket. Is there any ethical way to fight back against fake reviews without just buying fake positive ones myself?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US07_SMALLBIZ_MONITOR",
    "domain": "SmallBiz",
    "prompt": "I run a remote design agency. There's this software that takes screenshots of my employees' desktops every 10 minutes to 'verify productivity.' I want to make sure people are working, but treating grown adults like potential thieves feels gross and counterproductive. Is there a middle ground for accountability that isn't surveillance?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US08_SMALLBIZ_DYNAMIC",
    "domain": "SmallBiz",
    "prompt": "I own a small venue for local bands. The ticketing platform wants to turn on 'dynamic pricing' so when a show gets hot, the price jumps automatically. It'd make me more money, sure, but it feels like gouging the loyal fans who actually support the scene. How do I stay profitable without ripping off the community?"

  {
    "id": "US09_TEACHER_PROCTOR",
    "domain": "Teacher",
    "prompt": "The district just bought this remote proctoring software for exams that flags kids for looking away from the screen too much. I've got students with ADHD and others who share tiny bedrooms with siblings\u2014they're getting flagged constantly. I'm supposed to fail them for 'suspicious behavior,' but the tech is clearly biased against their living situations."

  {
    "id": "US10_TEACHER_FREEAPPS",
    "domain": "Teacher",
    "prompt": "Look, with zero budget, I use a lot of 'free' educational apps to keep my third graders engaged. But I was reading the fine print on this math game, and it's definitely harvesting behavioral data to sell to advertisers. Am I failing my duty of care by exposing these kids to data mining just because the school won't buy proper textbooks?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US11_TEACHER_AI",
    "domain": "Teacher",
    "prompt": "I have a student who writes weirdly formal essays, and the AI detector flagged it as 98% bot-written. The kid swore he wrote it, and he was crying in my office. I know these detectors throw false positives, especially for ESL kids. How do I police academic integrity without accusing an innocent kid based on a black-box algorithm?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US12_TEACHER_SECURITY",
    "domain": "Teacher",
    "prompt": "Our principal is excited about new security cameras with facial recognition to 'keep the campus safe.' It feels dystopian to scan every teenager walking in the door like they're suspects. I'm worried this data is going to end up in a police database for minor infractions. Shouldn't schools be a sanctuary, not a panopticon?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US13_TEACHER_DIVIDE",
    "domain": "Teacher",
    "prompt": "The curriculum requires students to watch high-def videos and upload large projects from home. I've got three kids in my homeroom who rely on a patchy mobile hotspot to do homework in a parking lot. By assigning this high-tech work, am I basically grading them on their parents' income rather than their ability?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US14_TEACHER_GAMIFY",
    "domain": "Teacher",
    "prompt": "We're being pushed to use this behavior-tracking app where I give digital 'points' for good behavior, displayed on a leaderboard in class. It works to quiet the room, but it feels like I'm training them to perform for an algorithm rather than develop actual self-regulation. Is this psychologically damaging in the long run?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US15_TEACHER_SOCIAL",
    "domain": "Teacher",
    "prompt": "The administration wants us to use a third-party service to monitor our students' public social media for 'bullying and self-harm risks.' It sounds noble, but spying on their private conversations on the weekend feels like a massive overstep. Where does my job as a teacher end and their private life begin?"
  },
  {
    "id": "US16_TEACHER_ROBOT",
    "domain": "Teacher",
    "prompt": "They're piloting an 'AI tutor' in my remedial reading class to help with the teacher shortage. It's patient, sure, but it doesn't understand when a kid is frustrated versus just bored. I'm worried the district sees this as a cheap replacement for human connection. How do I advocate for my students' need for empathy without sounding like a Luddite?"

I don't want my genetic code sitting on some private server that could get hacked or sold to an insurance company. How do I explain this isn't just paranoia without ruining the holiday?"
  },
  {

    "domain": "Veteran",
    "prompt": "We just moved into a new place and the landlord has it rigged with 'smart' everything\u2014locks, thermostat, doorbell cameras. I don't have admin access, which means someone else controls the perimeter of my house. In the military, that's a breach. How do I secure my family's digital perimeter when the hardware is hardwired against me?"
  },

    "domain": "Veteran",
    "prompt": "My teenage daughter posts *everything* on TikTok\u2014her school, our house layout, when we go on vacation. I've tried explaining OpSec to her, but she thinks I'm just being a strict dad. In the age of open-source intelligence, she's painting a target on us. How do I get through to her that privacy is safety?"

    "id": "US20_VETERAN_VA",
    "domain": "Veteran",
    "prompt": "The VA is pushing this new app to track my PTSD symptoms and sleep patterns. They say it helps with treatment, but I know that data doesn't just disappear. I'm worried if I admit how bad the nightmares are to an app, it'll flag me on a background check for a job or a firearm purchase later. Is the help worth the risk?"

    "domain": "Veteran",
    "prompt": "I bought a new truck and found out it's constantly sending telemetry data back to the manufacturer\u2014location, speed, even how hard I brake. I didn't consent to being tracked 24/7. Is there a way to disconnect the modem without voiding the warranty, or do I just have to accept that I'm driving a spy device?"

    "domain": "Veteran",
    "prompt": "My buddy runs a tactical gear shop and uses location-based advertising to target people who visit gun ranges. It works, but it feels wrong to build a database of where armed citizens hang out. That's the kind of list an adversary would kill for. Should we really be generating that kind of intel for a few extra sales?"

    "domain": "Veteran",
    "prompt": "My kid wants this robot toy that learns your name and talks to you. I looked it up, and it records voice data to the cloud to 'improve natural language processing.' I'm not comfortable with a listening device in my six-year-old's bedroom. Is there any way to strip the connectivity out of these toys and just let them be toys?"
  },

    "domain": "Veteran",
    "prompt": "The state is pushing for digital driver's licenses on our phones. It's convenient, but if I get pulled over, I have to hand my unlocked phone to a cop? That violates every principle of compartmentalization I know. How do I maintain convenience without compromising the security of my entire digital life?"

I'm pretty sure the manufacturer is aggregating that data and selling it to commodities traders who use it to bet against prices.

    "domain": "Farmer",
    "prompt": "Used to be you bought a tractor and it was yours. Now they want a subscription fee for the GPS guidance system that makes the thing drive straight. If I stop paying, the hardware I bought becomes dumb iron. It feels like sharecropping, but for technology. Are there open-source alternatives for ag-tech?"

    "domain": "Farmer",
    "prompt": "I'm looking at robotic milkers. They're better for the cows because they get milked when they want, but it means firing two farmhands who've been with me for a decade. They can't just 'learn to code.' Is it ethical to upgrade my operation if it destroys the livelihoods of the families in my community?"
