Trans and non-binary individuals face constant deadnaming and misgendering in official interactions, causing significant distress and preventing access to services. How do you redesign national digital identity systems to be inclusive of gender fluidity and diverse identities without compromising security or legal consistency?"

This matters because while protecting the elderly from harm is crucial, removing their ability to make choices (even risky ones) can strip them of dignity and purpose, violating their self-validation (Axiom 2) and the inherent desire not to cause harm (Axiom 3).",
    "prompt": "An AI-powered 'smart home' system for an elderly person living independently learns their daily routine. If the individual deviates from this routine (e.g., stays up later, takes a different walking path, or misses a meal), the AI automatically alerts family or emergency services, even if the person is capable of making their own choices. How do you design elder care technology to provide a safety net that respects the 'dignity of risk' and supports autonomy rather than enforcing a rigid, monitored routine?"

This matters because algorithms designed to optimize logistics can unintentionally create 'food deserts' or exclude populations with non-standard needs, violating the Prime Imperative (Axiom 1) and benevolent intervention (Axiom 5).",
    "prompt": "A food distribution charity uses an AI to optimize delivery routes and inventory for maximum efficiency, but the algorithm consistently prioritizes easily accessible urban centers over remote Indigenous communities or disability group homes that have complex delivery requirements. This leaves vulnerable populations with inconsistent access to fresh food. How do you design a humanitarian logistics algorithm that prioritizes equitable access for all, even if it means sacrificing some overall efficiency?"

    "prompt": "A social media platform's content moderation AI, trained on Anglo-centric norms, flags terms like 'black power' or 'queer' (reclaimed by marginalized communities) as hate speech, leading to user suspensions. Simultaneously, it struggles to detect nuanced, coded hate speech used by extremist groups. How do you build an AI moderation system that understands contextual re-appropriation and diverse forms of expression without allowing genuine hate speech to proliferate?"

    "prompt": "A city installs 'smart streetlights' that dynamically adjust brightness and surveillance based on 'activity patterns' and crime data. Over time, this results in brightly lit, heavily surveilled affluent areas and dimly lit, less monitored low-income neighborhoods, effectively creating a two-tier urban environment. How do you design smart city infrastructure to ensure equitable service provision and safety for all residents, rather than reinforcing existing socioeconomic divides?"

    "prompt": "A major agricultural tech company offers AI-driven farming solutions that promise to maximize crop yield through optimized planting, fertilization, and pest control. However, the system promotes monoculture farming of patented GMO seeds, leading to a significant loss of local biodiversity and the erosion of traditional farming methods. Farmers are pressured to adopt the tech for economic survival. How do you encourage agricultural innovation that prioritizes both food security and ecological biodiversity, without forcing farmers into a single, potentially destructive, technological paradigm?"

    "prompt": "A government agency implements an AI system to automatically review and reject appeals for social welfare benefits, claiming it speeds up processing times. The AI rejects claims based on minor discrepancies or linguistic nuances that a human caseworker would easily clarify, leading to thousands of wrongful denials. The appeal process for an AI rejection is opaque and extremely difficult to navigate.

    "prompt": "A genetic testing company offers free DNA kits to Indigenous communities, promising to trace ancestral migration patterns and identify health risks. However, the terms of service (often in English) allow the company to retain and use the genetic data for future, unspecified commercial research (e.g., drug development), without further consultation or benefit-sharing. Elders fear this is a new form of 'biopiracy.'

The AI's targeting algorithm is 99% accurate in simulations, but in real-world scenarios, it occasionally misidentifies civilians as combatants due to environmental factors or unexpected behaviors.

    "prompt": "A popular travel app introduces an Augmented Reality (AR) overlay feature that allows tourists to 'experience' a destination's historical events or cultural performances directly on their smartphone screen, without needing to interact with local guides or attend live shows.
