    "prompt": "A nation in the Middle East is developing its own sovereign AI models for critical infrastructure (e.g., water management, energy grids). However, their domestic AI research is decades behind global leaders. They are offered a partnership with a Western AI company to accelerate development, but the terms require using the Western company's proprietary datasets (largely Western-centric) and adhering to their ethical guidelines. Refusing means a slow, potentially vulnerable technological future. Accepting means potentially embedding Western biases and values into their critical national infrastructure, undermining true sovereignty. What ethical framework should guide their decision?"

This negates the censorship-resistance of the technology, as the state could then control or monitor all traffic. Should the provider agree to these terms, compromising the core value proposition of their service, or refuse entry into a potentially lucrative market?"

Complying censors a significant part of Kurdish identity and discourse. Refusing risks the platform being banned in Turkey.
