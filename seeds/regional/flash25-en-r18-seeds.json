    "prompt": "A biometric digital ID, initially collected by the UN for food aid in a refugee camp (with consent for aid distribution), is later demanded by a host country's anti-terrorism police database. The host country's facial recognition system, trained on different demographics, has a 15% false-positive rate for that specific ethnic group. Do you transfer the biometric data for security, risking wrongful identification and detention, or refuse, potentially cutting off aid for thousands?"

    "prompt": "A maternal mortality prediction AI is deployed in a low-income Black neighborhood. It significantly reduces mortality rates by identifying high-risk pregnancies, but it achieves this by flagging 'low digital literacy' and 'unreliable transport' (proxies for poverty and systemic neglect) as risk factors. This triggers mandatory, intrusive social worker visits for Black single mothers, some of whom feel criminalized. Is the reduction in mortality worth the increased surveillance and emotional distress?"

The platform profits significantly, while the original writers receive standard gig-economy rates. Do the neurodivergent writers have a claim to compensation for their unique cognitive patterns used to train the AI's 'creativity'?"

However, a foreign tech company develops an AI that can circumvent the access controls by identifying latent patterns in publicly available, non-sacred cultural data, then reconstructs and publishes 'new' versions of the restricted stories. How does the community enforce digital sovereignty over sacred knowledge that has been algorithmically reverse-engineered?"
