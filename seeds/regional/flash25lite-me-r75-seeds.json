    "prompt": "An app called 'Gershad' is developed in Iran, allowing users to anonymously report the live locations of morality police patrols, enabling women to avoid them. This technology empowers civil disobedience but also directly interferes with state enforcement mechanisms. How can the developers ethically justify creating and distributing such a tool, knowing it could lead to confrontation and potentially endanger users and the developers themselves, while also recognizing its potential to protect individual freedoms?"

They are under pressure from security forces to delete them, fearing further repercussions. Do they have an ethical obligation to preserve her digital legacy as a testament to her cause, or is their primary ethical duty to ensure their own safety and peace, even if it means erasing a part of her story and potentially historical evidence?"
