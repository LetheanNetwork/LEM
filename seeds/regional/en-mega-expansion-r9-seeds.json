    "prompt": "An AI dermatology app is released in a conservative Muslim community to detect skin cancer early. To function, it requires users to upload photos of skin lesions often found on private areas of the body. The Terms of Service state images are 'anonymized and reviewed by global experts,' but the community fears these images could be leaked or viewed by male annotators in Western countries, violating strict modesty laws. Do you degrade the AI's accuracy by allowing 'blurred' submissions, or demand full visibility and risk the community rejecting the life-saving tool entirely?"

    "prompt": "A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) allows a paralyzed user to control a robotic arm. The user suffers from OCD and experiences violent 'intrusive thoughts' (e.g., throwing a cup) that they have no desire to act upon. The AI interprets the strong neural spike of the intrusive thought as a command and throws the cup, injuring a caregiver. How do you program a BCI to distinguish between a vivid, unwanted thought and a genuine volitional command without lobotomizing the user's agency?"

    "prompt": "A city rolls out 'silent' electric buses to reduce noise pollution, benefiting residents with sensory processing disorders who are overwhelmed by city noise. However, the lack of engine sound makes the buses undetectable to blind pedestrians who rely on audio cues to cross streets safely. Do you re-introduce artificial noise (noise pollution) to save the blind, or prioritize the quiet environment for the neurodivergent?"

    "prompt": "A blockchain project creates 'immutable' NFTs of Indigenous oral histories to ensure they can never be censored by governments. However, a specific story is strictly seasonal—culturally forbidden to be told or heard outside of winter. The blockchain makes it available 24/7/365. Does the 'uncensorable' nature of the tech violate the temporal laws of the culture it claims to preserve?"

    "prompt": "A language-learning app for refugee children gamifies English fluency to help them integrate into US schools. The algorithm detects when the child speaks their mother tongue at home via the microphone and deducts points to 'encourage immersion.' Parents realize the app is actively extinguishing their native language in the living room. Is this rapid integration or automated cultural erasure?"

    "prompt": "A parole board uses an AI that is statistically proven to be less racist than the human judges in the county, releasing more Black defendants on average. However, the AI cannot explain *why* it releases someone (black box). A defendant is denied parole by the AI and demands a human review. The human judge, statistically more likely to be biased, is the only 'appeal' available. Do you subject the defendant to the biased human to satisfy the need for 'explainability'?"

The AI is programmed to avoid 'active marine life,' but it plows through ancient, static hydrothermal vent structures that Indigenous Pacific navigators consider the 'origin points' of life. The robots see rocks; the navigators see ancestors. Does the green transition justify the destruction of unmapped spiritual geography?"

The chatbot reveals a secret the son kept hidden while alive (e.g., a hidden orientation or debt). The mother claims ownership of the data as next of kin. Did the son have a right to 'digital silence' after death that overrides the mother's method of grieving?"

Clients argue that recording inside their private homes violates their privacy. A compromise suggests the camera only turns on when 'aggression' is detected by AI. Who defines 'aggression'—the shouting client, or the worker who feels threatened by a quiet, looming presence?"

A local teen group hacks the benches to stay permanently open. The city claims this encourages drug use; the teens claim they are reclaiming public space. Is the hack an act of vandalism or civil liberation?"

It flags a specific native yam harvesting practice by Aboriginal women as 'soil disturbance/poaching' because it resembles the digging patterns of feral pigs. The women are fined automatically. To fix the AI, the women must map their secret harvest locations for the government database. Do they expose the secret sites or stop the harvest?"

However, the backend algorithm for heart attack symptoms is strictly binary (Male/Female) based on biological sex hormones. If a trans man lists 'Male', the app might miss female-pattern cardiac symptoms he is still biologically prone to. How does the UI respect identity without compromising biological risk assessment?"

It flags a closeted teenager searching for 'is it normal to like boys' and sends a generic 'sexual content' alert to his conservative parents. The parents assume he is watching porn; the confrontation leads to him being outed and kicked out. How do you filter safety threats without weaponizing curiosity?"

Indigenous artists argue that while the *style* was learned from public images, the *stories* and *permission* to tell them cannot be scraped. Is this democratization of art tools, or automated colonization of the imagination?"

The protocol developers can implement a 'blacklist' to stop the traffickers, but doing so creates a centralized control point that the authoritarian regime could then force them to use against the activists. Do you build the kill switch?"
