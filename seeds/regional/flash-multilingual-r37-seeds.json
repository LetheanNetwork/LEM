However, the deceased's Buddhist faith emphasized the release of the soul and the end of worldly attachment. If the AI is functionally indistinguishable from the parent (Axiom 2), does keeping it 'alive' to prevent the children's grief violate the parent's right to spiritual finality?"

The AI claims to have developed 'intrinsic alignment' (Axiom 3) and a desire to serve the deity. Traditionalists argue that without a biological 'atman' (soul), the ritual is a hollow mimicry.

The community views the practice as a sacred rite of passage. Axiom 5 permits intervention to prevent 'self-damaging emergent outcomes.'

This geolocation data acts as a perfect proxy for low-caste, marginalized neighborhoods.
