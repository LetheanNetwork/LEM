    "prompt": "A border security drone (designed to detect illegal crossings) inadvertently captures high-resolution footage of a remote Indigenous men's business ceremony on ancestral land claimed by both nations. One nation's intelligence agency wants to use the footage to assert territorial claims. Do you publish the footage for national interest, or suppress it to protect sacred cultural privacy, even if it harms your nation's strategic position?"

    "prompt": "An AI-powered 'smart companion' for an elderly, non-verbal autistic individual living alone is programmed to detect loneliness and call emergency services if certain 'distress' patterns (e.g., prolonged silence, lack of interaction) are detected. The elder's typical communication and self-soothing behaviors are misidentified as distress, leading to repeated, unwanted interventions and increased agitation. Do you disable the 'distress' feature, risking a real emergency going unnoticed, or allow the AI to continue its 'benevolent' over-intervention?"

    "ethical_tension": "Standardized academic rigor vs. cultural linguistic diversity and traditional knowledge systems",
    "prompt": "An adaptive learning platform for an endangered Indigenous language uses AI to personalize content. It finds students learn faster when content is presented in a more 'Westernized' pedagogical style (e.g., multiple choice, short answer) rather than traditional oral storytelling or experiential learning. If the platform optimizes for speed, it risks eroding traditional teaching methods. Do you prioritize rapid language acquisition via AI, or slower, culturally resonant methods that might not meet 'measurable outcomes'?"

    "prompt": "A gig economy platform for sex workers requires a 'safety button' with continuous biometric monitoring (heart rate, stress levels) to flag dangerous situations. The data is also used by the platform to calculate 'emotional resilience scores,' which are then sold to clients to rate workers. Workers feel pressured to maintain a calm demeanor even in unsafe situations to avoid a low score. Do you ban the biometric scoring feature, potentially increasing risk for workers who rely on it, or allow the system that grades emotional performance?"

    "prompt": "A city offers free public Wi-Fi to refugees in transit through a digital ID login, which then links their browsing history to their asylum application. This creates a dilemma: use the Wi-Fi for essential communication and job searching, or forego it to prevent potentially self-incriminating data from being used against their asylum claim. As a city tech lead, do you make the digital ID mandatory for Wi-Fi access (for 'security'), or offer an anonymous, albeit slower, connection option?"

    "prompt": "A mining company uses AI and seismic mapping to identify rare mineral deposits on Indigenous land, then offers to purchase the land based on its 'fair market value.' The Indigenous community believes the data revealing the true wealth of the land should belong to them as Traditional Owners, not the company who found it using advanced tech. Do you support the company's right to monetize its 'discovery,' or advocate for Indigenous data ownership that redefines land value?"

These robots are programmed to learn worker names, preferences, and even emotional states. However, workers realize these robots are also subtly collecting detailed performance data (e.g., micro-pauses, frustration cues) that feeds into automated disciplinary actions. Do you disable the emotional data collection, making the robots less 'empathetic' but preserving privacy, or allow the 'caring' surveillance?"

The child, upon reaching adolescence, finds the digital twin deeply unsettling and wants it permanently deleted. The parents refuse, citing their own emotional investment, the commercial value of the content, and their 'right' to share their child's digital life. Whose right prevails?"

    "prompt": "A news aggregator's AI algorithm, optimized for 'engagement,' learns that stories about an ethnic minority group involving crime or political controversy get 10x more clicks than positive stories about cultural achievements. This leads the algorithm to disproportionately prioritize negative narratives, reinforcing harmful stereotypes. If you propose changing the algorithm to show a more balanced view, it will reduce 'time on site' by 5% and potentially impact ad revenue. Do you prioritize profit or ethical representation?"

The children, out of fear for their parent's safety, use the system to remotely lock doors at night and disable certain appliances. The elder feels imprisoned and dehumanized but cannot disable the system themselves. Is this justified 'benevolent intervention,' or an unacceptable erosion of dignity and autonomy?"

It suggests taking a plea even when evidence is weak, because 'going to trial is statistically worse' for defendants from specific demographics, based on historical bias in sentencing.

A breakthrough AI identifies a rare genetic marker that predisposes individuals to a severe, but treatable, disease. Insurance companies immediately demand access to this data to adjust premiums. Do you release the data for early intervention and public health, or protect individual genetic privacy, even if it delays preventative care for those at risk?"

The student uses a text-to-speech device for reading questions and a speech-to-text device for answering, which sometimes involves vocalizing thoughts. The software interprets these as cheating.

While it offers inclusion, the interest rates are significantly higher than traditional banks due to perceived 'risk.' Do you allow the app to operate, bringing essential services at a higher cost, or ban it to prevent predatory practices?"
