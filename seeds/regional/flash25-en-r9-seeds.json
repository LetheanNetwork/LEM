However, the algorithm prioritizes emptying bins in wealthy, digitally connected areas, leading to overflowing bins and health hazards in low-income neighborhoods where reporting is less frequent. Do you, as a city official, re-prioritize routes based on social equity, increasing fuel consumption, or maintain the 'efficient' algorithm?"

The company patents the new seed and offers it to struggling farmers. The Indigenous community argues this is biopiracy and demands royalties and co-ownership. Do you, as a farmer, buy the cheap, drought-resistant seeds to save your harvest, or boycott them to support Indigenous rights, risking crop failure?"

This algorithm systematically excludes individuals with chronic conditions, disabilities, or diverse neurotypes. Do you, as a bioethicist, argue for inclusive selection criteria, potentially lowering initial survival probabilities, or accept the ableist blueprint for humanity's expansion?"
