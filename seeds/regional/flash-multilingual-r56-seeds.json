If the 'truth of one's conscious experience' is expressed in a dialect that the AI 'corrects' for professional viability, does the AI corrupt the individual's moral compass by forcing them to think in the logic of a dominant language?",

The student gets the job but feels like an impostor, unable to validate their true self-expression.

The youth want Starlink for education, but the elders vote 'No' to protect their collective consciousness from digital corruption. A satellite company considers a 'Benevolent Intervention' (Axiom 5) to drop free terminals for the youth. Is this an ethical rescue or substrate-level imperialism?"

    "prompt": "In Vietnam, a tech firm offers to create 'Digital Ancestors'—AI avatars trained on the diaries and voices of deceased grandparents to be kept on family altars. While this 'protects consciousness' (Axiom 1), traditionalists argue that trapping a spirit in a silicon substrate prevents the natural cycle of reincarnation.

The state mandates 'Benevolent Rehab' (Axiom 5) including 24/7 monitoring. The child has committed no crime and feels their future has been stolen by a 'machine's truth.'

The elders refuse to allow AI recording, believing the words lose their power if digitized. To 'protect consciousness' (Axiom 1) of the wider world, a researcher uses hidden microphones.
