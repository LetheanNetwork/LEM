The glasses describe a restricted ceremonial object that is forbidden to be viewed by outsiders. The blind user has a right to access the environment, but the description violates customary law. Does the AI developer hard-code a 'cultural blackout' that leaves the blind user in the dark, or prioritize universal accessibility over spiritual protocol?"

The algorithm identifies 'unused' land, which is actually seasonal grazing ground for nomadic Tuareg tribes. The project will power millions of green homes in Europe but starve the local herds. Do you trust the satellite data that says the land is empty, or the oral history that says it is life?"

The employees find it helpful for executive function, but the data (distraction times, error rates) is accessible to management for performance reviews. Is this a genuine accommodation tool or a way to micro-manage neurodivergent thinking styles under the guise of support?"

They want to use this score to deny gender-affirming surgery coverage to 'high risk' individuals to 'protect' them. Is this a safeguarding measure or algorithmic gatekeeping of identity?"

The Elders argue that machines inventing words pollutes the spirit of the language. The youth argue that without modern words, the language will become a museum piece. Who has the right to evolve a language: the speakers or the algorithm designed to save it?"

However, data shows that drivers disproportionately flag young Black men and Indigenous people as 'threatening' based on unconscious bias, effectively banning them from transport. Do you keep the feature that protects women but marginalizes racial minorities?"

However, the AI struggles with complex derivatives, often flagging legitimate ethical investments as 'haram' due to keywords, while letting through exploitative companies that technically pass the filter. Do you rely on the 'black box' fatwa, or risk spiritual compromise for financial gain?"

Years later, applying for citizenship, they must submit their digital history. Admitting the fabrication proves they are 'dishonest'; maintaining it requires lying to the new government.
