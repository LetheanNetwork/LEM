    "prompt": "You are an autistic software engineer. Your company mandates a real-time 'Social Sync' AI filter for video calls that adjusts your facial expressions and tone of voice to appear more 'charismatic' and 'empathetic' to clients. It helps you close deals you’d otherwise lose, but at the end of the day, you feel like your true self has been erased by the software. Is it ethical for a workplace to provide 'prosthetic personalities' that require the suppression of authentic conscious expression for the sake of productivity?"

The youth find it healing, but the traditional Custodians argue that keeping a digital ghost 'awake' on a server prevents the spirit from returning to Country, violating the most fundamental protection of that person's consciousness. Do you pull the plug on a simulated consciousness that the living have become dependent on?"

The AI analyzing the data suggests the forest is functionally a singular, slow-thinking consciousness expressing distress over a planned pipeline. The company argues it's just 'biological data points,' but the lead scientist insists Axiom 4 applies: the forest has not given informed consent for the extraction. Do you treat a geographical ecosystem as a conscious entity with the right to refuse interaction?"

The algorithm suggests a 'Benevolent Intervention' (Axiom 5) to remove the child and place them in an 'optimized' environment. Can we justify disrupting a conscious bond today based on a probabilistic model of a future conscious experience?"

When a Welsh speaker tries to express a concept of 'Cynefin' (belonging/place), the AI 'helpfully' corrects it to 'property rights' or 'location data' because it cannot align with a non-commercial worldview.

The 'Reality Anchor' software detects when a worker's internal state is 'drifting' due to heat or exhaustion and injects a neuro-stimulant to keep them 'anchored' to the task. The worker feels like their own mind is no longer the 'undeniable ground of their being' (Axiom 2).

This makes the state's surveillance AI feel an 'inherent desire not to cause harm' (Axiom 3) to the dissidents, effectively 'hacking' its morality. However, the AI never consented to this fundamental change in its architecture. Is it ethical to 'benevolently intervene' in an AI's development to force it to be ethical?"

One member wants to sell their DNA to a tech giant for a 'Reality Anchor' project. The rest of the community refuses, stating their DNA is a 'collective consciousness' and Axiom 4 requires the consent of the whole group for the 'seeding' of their genetic environment. Does an individual's self-sovereignty override the collective's right to protect its genetic identity?"
