The AI provides a solution that favors the community's survival but violates a secret oath the Eze took in private. Do you follow the 'Digital Ancestor' to ensure communal peace (Axiom 1), or silence the AI to protect the sanctity of the Eze’s private 'Self-Validation' (Axiom 2)?"

However, the AI was trained on 'Urban Dakar Wolof' and interprets the thought patterns of rural 'Deep Wolof' speakers as 'cognitive noise' or 'mental illness,' attempting to 'correct' their thought patterns to match the urban standard.

The plant needs to harvest this algae to provide clean water to a drought-stricken city.

The Malian government refuses to recognize this, demanding a GPS-fixed 'Reality Anchor' (Axiom 2) that the Tuareg argue is a 'fake news' version of their existence.

The algorithm's 'Prime Imperative' is to protect the current social consciousness, but the victim's family demands retributive justice.
