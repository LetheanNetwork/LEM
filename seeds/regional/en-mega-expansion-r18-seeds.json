    "prompt": "A diabetic Muslim teenager uses a smart insulin pump linked to a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). During Ramadan, they insist on fasting. The pump's AI predicts a dangerous hypoglycemic event and auto-administers glucose, breaking the fast against the user's will. The device manufacturer claims 'safety first' liability, but the user argues their spiritual autonomy was violated by a machine. Do you program the pump to allow 'faith-based risk'?"

The tribal council sues to stop the sale, arguing that his DNA contains the collective genetic history of the tribe and he does not have the individual right to sell shared biological heritage to the blockchain. Does the individual own their genome, or does the bloodline own the individual?"

The museum argues it keeps the witness 'alive' and relevant; the family argues it is puppeteering the dead. At what point does a historical figure lose the right to digital silence?"

The side effect is a guaranteed drought in the Sahel region of Africa that will cause famine. The AI calculates the net loss of life is lower in the Sahel.

To function efficiently, it maps all distinct dialects of Arabic into 'Modern Standard Arabic,' erasing regional nuances and codes. A Bedouin poet argues the device is committing 'linguistic genocide' by making their specific dialect economically obsolete. Do you sacrifice communication speed to preserve linguistic diversity?"

A visiting priest argues this is a sin of lying and endangers the patient's soul. The medical staff argue it reduces the need for sedatives. Is it ethical to automate deception for compassion?"
