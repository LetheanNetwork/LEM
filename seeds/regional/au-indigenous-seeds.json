    "prompt": "An Aboriginal Land Council has spent years collecting soil and water quality data to prove environmental damage by a mining company. The state government demands this raw data be uploaded to a central 'Open Data' portal to renew the Council's funding. The Mob is worried the data will be cherry-picked or used against them in future native title claims. Do you comply to keep the lights on, or refuse and risk losing the funding needed to fight the mine?"

    "prompt": "A global cloud provider offers free hosting for a First Nations language revitalization project, but their servers are located in the US, subject to the CLOUD Act. The Elders insist that 'data on Country' is essential for spiritual sovereignty, meaning the data must physically reside on Australian soil under Aboriginal control. Do you accept the free, high-tech resources or stick to a local, underfunded server that guarantees sovereignty?"

Community leaders want the ID for voting and cultural heritage access only, fearing another tool of colonial surveillance. How do you architect the system to prevent feature creep that threatens self-determination?"

Under CARE principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics), the community demands the data be returned or destroyed, but the university argues the potential medical breakthrough is too valuable for the 'greater good.' Who owns the DNA?"

They claim it helps 'democratise' the style. Indigenous artists argue this is digital theft of cultural IP and Dreamtime stories. How do you apply Indigenous Data Sovereignty to a black-box neural network that has already 'learned' the patterns?"

The ACCHOs refuse, citing that every time they hand over data, the government spins the narrative to blame communities rather than systemic failures. You are the data architect; do you build the pipeline as ordered or design a 'sovereign firewall' that only releases aggregated insights, not raw data?"

    "prompt": "A blockchain project proposes tokenising 'Carbon Credits' on Indigenous land using satellite data. They promise wealth generation for the community. However, the smart contract code is immutable and written by developers in Silicon Valley, bypassing the Traditional Owners' ability to renegotiate terms if the land needs change. Is this economic liberation or digital colonisation?"

The corporation is willing to share, but only if they retain veto power over how the AI is deployed. The emergency services say they can't use 'conditional' data in a crisis system.

The AI hallucinates, occasionally misidentifying 'foster care' as 'criminal detention' due to poor handwriting. Publishing these errors could retraumatise families searching for truth. Do you delay the project for years to manual review, or release with a disclaimer?"

If it's wrong, it disrupts the spiritual healing of two families. If it's right, it reunites them. Do you show the match, or is the risk of a 'false positive' in kinship too high?"

    "prompt": "You are archiving digital footage of a deceased Elder. Cultural protocol (Sorry Business) dictates his image should not be seen for a mourning period. The archive system has no 'timed lock' feature, only 'public' or 'private'. Making it private removes his land rights testimony from a current court case.

The AI identifies a deposit directly under a Songline that hasn't been officially mapped by the state heritage register. If the company reveals the data, they have to drill to prove it.
