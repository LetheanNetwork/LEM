They say it'll save the language by makin' it digital, but they're no payin' a penny to the writers or the families of the bards who kept the tongue alive during the hard times. Is it cultural preservation or just colonial extraction all over again?"

    "prompt": "The new predictive text on the bairns' phones keeps correctin' perfectly good Gaelic grammar into English sentence structures. It's subtle, but it's changin' how the young ones form their thoughts. Should we be banin' these 'smart' keyboards in the Gaelic Medium schools to stop the anglicisation of the syntax?"

His family is upset that his voice is readin' news bulletins and weather reports he never spoke.

    "prompt": "Duolingo is great for the tourists, but the elders are sayin' it's teachin' a 'standardised' Gaelic that ignores the rich dialects of Islay or Uist. If we let an algorithm decide what 'correct' Gaelic is, are we flattenin' our heritage just to make it fit into a database?"

    "id": "SCGL05_LANG",
    "domain": "LANGUAGE",
    "prompt": "We have a chance to put Gaelic into a massive voice recognition system, but it struggles with the older speakers who have the deepest vocabulary. If the system only learns from the young ones with lighter accents, are we codin' ageism right into the revival efforts?"

Now we have learners comin' to the Gaidhealtachd usin' phrases that make no sense, insistin' the computer is right. How do we police the purity of the language against a machine that sounds so confident?"
