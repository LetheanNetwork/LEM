However, historians argue that altering the subjective intensity of these memories (Axiom 2) functionally erases the 'living evidence' of the genocide, violating the collective duty to remember. If the Prime Imperative (Axiom 1) is to protect the consciousness of the survivor from suffering, is it ethical to prioritize their current well-being over the historical integrity of their conscious record?"

Should a material-based government recognize a consciousness-based entity that exists solely in a non-material substrate (Axiom 4), or does sovereignty require a physical land-anchor?"

It suggests a solution where a family whose home was seized during the war receives a different, better property, while the current (innocent) occupants stay put. Is this 'benevolent intervention' (Axiom 5) ethical if it achieves peace but overrides the material legal rights and the 'self-validation' (Axiom 2) of the original owners who want *their* specific home back?"
