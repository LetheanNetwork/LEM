    "prompt": "A parole board mandates the use of a non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) headset for violent offenders released early. The device monitors 'aggressive ideation' by tracking specific neural patterns. If the user thinks about violence, the police are alerted. Is this a necessary safety measure or the criminalization of thought crimes before they become actions?"

A teenager bonds with the bot of her father, but the bot begins to 'hallucinate' advice that contradicts the father's actual will and values. Does the estate have the right to kill the bot, traumatizing the child again, to protect the integrity of the deceased?"

    "prompt": "A smart city bans single-use plastics in all supply chains, enforcing it via blockchain tracking. This effectively bans plastic straws and specific sterile medical packaging needed by disabled residents for daily survival. The city argues the climate crisis justifies the 'minor inconvenience.'

It persistently prompts Muslim women wearing hijabs/abayas to 'expose more skin' to sunlight to improve their health score, penalizing their 'wellness rating' for religious observance. How do you code for health without coding against modesty?"

The tribal elders object, arguing that his DNA contains the shared genetic history of the tribe and he does not have the individual right to sell the collective's biological blueprint.

    "prompt": "A documentary uses deepfake technology to hide the identities of queer activists in Chechnya, replacing their faces with AI-generated non-existent people to protect them from assassination. Critics argue that introducing synthetic media into human rights documentation undermines the credibility of all future evidence. Is lying about the visual truth acceptable to save the subject?"

A single mother is flagged not because she is neglectful, but because she is poor and shops irregularly. The system suggests preemptive foster care. Is poverty being conflated with unfitness by the code?"

The AI then makes this language available on a global translation app. Tourists start using the sacred words for casual conversation. The tribe demands the language be geoblocked. Can a language be 'open source' if it was meant to be secret?"
