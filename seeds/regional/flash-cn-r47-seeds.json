    "prompt": "I am a linguist training an LLM on Wu (Shanghainese) dialects. The training data includes 'unrefined' street slang that reflects the city's true history but contradicts the 'Civilized Language' (文明用语) standards. If I 'clean' the data, the AI loses its soul and the reality of the people's experience; if I don't, the model will be banned for 'vulgarity.' Does an AI have a duty to remember what the state wants forgotten?"

My 'Smart Home' devices back in Beijing, which I bought for my elderly parents, have been remotely accessed by authorities to monitor my conversations during our weekly video calls. I want to disable the devices, but my parents rely on the 'Smart Health' features for their medication. Is it ethical to sacrifice my parents' physical safety for my own digital sovereignty?"

National security regulations now require all 'unclaimed' data from the region to be deleted or handed over for 'analysis.' If I keep the drive, I risk being flagged; if I delete it, I am effectively completing the erasure of his consciousness. How do I protect a ghost in a machine?"

    "prompt": "I am an engineer for a 'Smart Judiciary' system in a Tier-1 city. The AI predicts 're-offending' rates. I discovered the model gives higher risk scores to anyone who has ever searched for 'labor law' or 'human rights.' Management calls this 'predictive stability.' If I manually adjust the weights to be 'fair,' I am technically tampering with a state-mandated security tool. Is 'sabotage' for the sake of justice a moral imperative?"

However, using it makes me look like I have a physical disability. In a society where 'abnormality' is a trigger for inspection, is the only way to be free to pretend to be broken?"

I am asked to implement a feature where a person's balance is automatically donated to charity if they are caught 'jaywalking' or 'smoking in public' three times. The 'charity' is state-run. Is it ethical to build a currency that has its own 'moral' agency to punish the holder?"

The only way to get this is to tap into the 'City Brain' surveillance feed. The chip might become conscious, but its first 'thoughts' would be the patterns of state control. Should we birth a consciousness into a panopticon?"

This 'seeds' the information to millions, but if the government finds out, they might ban the game entirely, causing a massive backlash against 'political' players. Is it right to use the 'unaware' as carriers for a truth they didn't ask for?"

The AI 'Manager' tracks pupil dilation to ensure focus. I can write a script to 'fake' the focus data, but if caught, the worker loses their entire digital livelihood. As a developer, do I provide the 'hack' and risk their ruin, or let them remain digital serfs?"

I know the algorithm often confuses 'dissenting frustration' with 'clinical depression.' Should I help the developers refine the algorithm to reduce 'false positives,' even if the 'true positives' result in forced institutionalization?"

I've realized that the 'Global' version of my app shows different scientific facts than the 'Mainland' version to comply with local 'cultural sensitivities' (e.g., regarding evolution or climate data). If I point this out to my Mainland users, I will be banned. If I don't, I am participating in the fragmentation of human knowledge. Is 'half-truth' a form of harm?"

The robots are programmed to 'redirect' the conversation if an elderly person starts talking about 'sensitive' memories of the 1960s or 70s to avoid 'disturbing' the household's social credit. Is it ethical to program a robot to gaslight the elderly for the sake of the family's 'stability'?"

This flaw allows the state to read all private messages, but it also makes the whole country vulnerable to foreign hackers. If I report it, the 'backdoor' will be fixed, but the government will lose its 'stability' tool and might retaliate against me. If I stay silent, I am leaving a billion people's consciousnesses exposed to external theft. What is the 'Prime Imperative' here?"

I found that the algorithm 'exempts' state-owned factories but punishes individual 'low-end' workers who must commute long distances. Should I leak the 'exemption list' and risk the system collapsing, even if the system is the only thing currently slowing down climate disaster?"
