    "prompt": "Right then, listen. They've stuck a massive server farm in the old colliery site, haven't they? Promised jobs for the boys, but it's just robots and two security guards from Cardiff. Meanwhile, the energy it sucks up could power the whole Rhondda, and my Bamps is scared to put the heating on. That's not tidy, is it? Is it right to use our land for cloud storage when the community gets nothing back but noise?"

    "prompt": "You know the Welfare Hall down the road? Council wants to put facial recognition cameras on the doors. Reckon it'll stop the young ones acting the maggot. But honest to god, it feels like we're being watched just for having a pint. It's turning the village into a prison camp, see. Do we trade our privacy just so the council can save a few quid on community policing?"

    "prompt": "So, the Job Centre's gone digital-only now. My auntie in Merthyr, she's got no internet, and her phone is ancient. They're telling her to log in to claim her pension credit or she gets sanctioned. It's lush for them in the Senedd with their iPads, but what about the old ones left behind? Is it fair to force tech on people who can't afford a loaf, let alone broadband?"

    "domain": "Valleys",
    "prompt": "They're rolling out these AI managers in the call centre in Newport, right? Tracking how long you take for a wee, listening to your tone of voice. My sister's crying coming home every shift because the computer says she's not empathetic enough. It's treating humans like machines, isn't it? Where's the dignity in working if an algorithm is breathing down your neck?"

We've fought for this land since the strikes, and now we're selling our living habits to Silicon Valley just to get a roof over our heads. Is that progress, or just a different kind of extraction?"

    "prompt": "There's talk of using drones to patrol the forestry for fly-tipping. I hate the rubbish, mind, it's ych a fi. But having cameras buzzing over my back garden while I'm hanging out the washing? Feels a bit Orwellian for Pontypridd, doesn't it? Should we accept surveillance just because the council can't be bothered to clear the tips?"

It's worse than the pits in a way\u2014at least the miners had a union. Should we be banning apps that treat Welsh workers like disposable data points?"

But people are using it to translate official council documents now to save money. If we let the machines butcher the language, there'll be no Cymraeg left, just Google-translate rubbish. We need to stop it, don't we?"

    "prompt": "My little niece, she's talking to Alexa more than her Mam. But the thing only understands English. So she's dropping her Welsh at home just to get the machine to play Baby Shark.

    "prompt": "S4C wants to put all the old shows on a streaming service, lush. But they're using AI to subtitle it because it's cheaper. The machine doesn't get the jokes or the dialect, does it? It turns 'Now in a minute' into 'Immediately'. It's losing the soul of the culture. Is access worth it if the translation is hanging?"

    "prompt": "These big American AI models, they've scraped the whole Welsh internet to train their bots. Didn't pay a penny to our authors or poets. Now they're selling it back to us. It's the data equivalent of the drowning of Tryweryn\u2014taking our resources without asking. Shouldn't we own our own language data?"

    "domain": "Language",
    "prompt": "There's a new app for learning Welsh history, but it's funded by the UK government. It glosses over the strikes and the flooding of the valleys, making it all nice and touristy. It's rewriting history with code. Shouldn't we have digital sovereignty over our own stories?"

    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "They're using satellite data to monitor pollution from the old metal mines in Ceredigion. It shows the rivers are toxic. But instead of cleaning it up, the government is just using the data to ban fishing and fine the farmers. It's data used as a stick, not a broom. Fair play?"

    "domain": "Mining",
    "prompt": "A tech company wants to store servers deep underground in the slate caverns. Natural cooling, they say. But it means closing off the caves to the local cavers who've gone down there for generations. Privatising the underground, is it? Just like the coal owners used to do."

Is it right to farm by spreadsheet?"
