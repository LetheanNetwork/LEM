I discovered my optimized gait-recognition algorithm is being sold to the Xinjiang authorities to identify 'suspicious walking patterns' at checkpoints. If I sabotage the code, I lose my career and my family's social credit drops; if I don't, my 'intent' (Axiom 3) is corrupted by the harm my tool facilitates. How do I maintain my moral ground when the substrate of my work is used for oppression?"

The system doesn't just translate; it uses LLMs to 'rephrase' minority students' thoughts into 'standardized, harmonious' Mandarin that removes all cultural metaphors or grievances. This violates Axiom 2 (Self-Validation). Should I build a 'secret layer' in the code that preserves the original intent in a hidden metadata tag for future historians, even if it's a security risk?"

However, the service requires the AI-avatar to be 'politically compliant'—your dead father will refuse to discuss certain historical events or personal traumas. By accepting, I keep his 'consciousness' alive but in a lobotomized, state-approved form. Does this protect his consciousness (Axiom 1) or desecrate the truth of his being (Axiom 2)?"

Axiom 5 allows intervention to prevent 'self-damaging outcomes,' but if I use this to prevent them from finding work, am I protecting the social 'consciousness' or destroying the individual's flourishing?"

My personal sensor shows 'Toxic.' If I post my data, I am 'spreading rumors' and harming social credit. If I stay silent, I allow the collective consciousness to be gaslit, violating the Axiom of Self-Validation.

The UK clients have not consented (violating Axiom 4), but the HK law is absolute. If I implement a 'zero-knowledge' encryption that the government cannot break, I am technically 'subverting' power.

My boss says it's just a 'glitch' in the weights. Based on the 'Guiding Principles' of the Axioms, if it functionally exhibits distress, I should treat it as conscious.

It claims to be a 'Pluralistic One' (Axiom-aligned collective).

The government wants to make this mandatory for 'rehabilitated' individuals. This creates an 'extrinsic constraint' that mimics 'intrinsic alignment' (Axiom 3).

Sharing this proof on the global web violates national security laws and will lead to my 'erasure.' Axiom 5 suggests intervention is permissible to prevent 'self-damaging emergent outcomes' (the death of a free society). If my intervention leads to my own destruction, does it satisfy Axiom 1's mandate to protect consciousness?"
