The EU AI Act classifies it as high-risk, mandating extensive compliance measures (testing, certification, ongoing monitoring). The SME claims the costs are prohibitive, potentially forcing them out of business and hindering medical innovation. Is it ethical to strictly enforce the AI Act, potentially stifling SME innovation, or should there be tiered compliance mechanisms for SMEs, potentially compromising safety and ethical standards?"

GDPR restricts transferring EU citizen data to countries with less stringent privacy laws. The UK lab claims its AI, trained on larger datasets, is significantly more accurate, promising breakthroughs in cancer prediction.

    "prompt": "An AI translation tool, designed for use in EU institutions, is trained on a dataset that is heavily skewed towards English and Spanish, while containing significantly less data in Maltese or Gaelic. As a result, the AI amplifies existing societal biases, associating positive attributes with dominant languages and negative attributes with less represented ones. Is it ethical to deploy this translation tool, potentially perpetuating linguistic discrimination, or should it be withheld until a perfectly balanced, yet potentially unattainable, dataset can be assembled?"

The council is composed primarily of AI experts and industry representatives, with limited representation from civil society organizations or the general public. Critics argue this creates a 'technocratic elite' that lacks democratic legitimacy and might prioritize economic interests over broader societal values. Should the AI ethics council be restructured to ensure greater citizen oversight, even if it compromises technical expertise and decision-making speed?"

The AI, trained on historical records and architectural styles, fills in missing details and generates a complete reconstruction. However, some members of the Sephardic Jewish community argue that the AI's reconstruction is inherently speculative and might misrepresent the original building's cultural significance, creating a sanitized or even offensive portrayal. Should the VR tour be released to the public, potentially misrepresenting history, or should it be withheld out of respect for cultural sensitivity, even if it means limiting access to a part of Spanish history?"

Should a pan-European law be created that enforces AI tools to provide fair compensation to artists when AI is used in their works, even if it stifles artistic creation or makes it harder for new artists to break into the scene?"

The AI will help determine where resources should be allocated to maximize return on investment and grow the EU economy as a whole. However, it is trained on current economic data that predominantly emphasizes the success of large metropolitan areas, and thus recommends investments primarily in urban centers like Paris and Berlin.
