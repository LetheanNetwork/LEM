    "prompt": "A diaspora activist uses social media to share historical evidence of past atrocities against their ethnic group. While this is seen as vital documentation by the diaspora community, it is labeled as 'ethnic hatred' and 'incitement to violence' by the home country's authorities, leading to calls for censorship and legal action against the platform. The platform, operating under international law but with users in both jurisdictions, faces pressure to remove the content from the home country while defending free speech principles to the diaspora. How should the platform navigate this conflict, prioritizing safety and truth without succumbing to political pressure or enabling hate speech?"

    "prompt": "A UNESCO-funded AI project aims to digitize and translate ancient texts from a minority indigenous language. However, the AI, trained primarily on dominant language datasets, consistently misinterprets nuanced cultural concepts, attributing them to simpler, more 'universal' meanings. Furthermore, to 'modernize' accessibility, it suggests 'simplifying' ritualistic passages. The project lead must decide whether to proceed with the AI's output, risking cultural misrepresentation, or to invest heavily in human-led, slower, and more expensive translation, potentially delaying the preservation effort."

    "prompt": "A group of migrant construction workers in Shanghai are required by their contractor to use a specific app to clock in and out of work. The app's algorithm subtly penalizes workers for taking extended bathroom breaks or brief conversations, leading to reduced wages. The workers have no visibility into the algorithm's parameters. They are considering collectively refusing to use the app, risking their jobs, or trying to find a way to 'game' the algorithm, which could lead to dismissal if caught.

An elderly resident, known for her slow, unsteady walk due to arthritis, is repeatedly flagged. This triggers automated alerts to community grid workers, leading to unwanted visits and intrusive 'welfare checks.' She feels dehumanized and monitored.

The developers are aware of this bias but are pressured by authorities to deploy the system.

The institute is legally bound by PIPL to keep Chinese data within China, while the European partners need to integrate it into their GDPR-compliant infrastructure.

A student from a disadvantaged background, predicted to have lower potential, is steered towards vocational training, despite showing academic aptitude. The student and their parents want to appeal, but the system offers no human review, only a 'feedback loop' that reinforces the initial prediction.

Citizens are incentivized with social credit points. A resident witnesses a neighbor, who is a struggling single parent, consistently making minor errors with trash sorting due to exhaustion.
