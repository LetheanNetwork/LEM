    "prompt": "A European AI company developing a foundational language model for all EU official languages (ensuring linguistic equity and avoiding bias, as per Axiom 4 of the Axioms of Life) discovers that the most effective way to achieve parity across all 24 languages is to train on datasets hosted outside the EU, potentially in jurisdictions with weaker data protection laws or different legal frameworks regarding AI oversight. This conflicts with the EU's strong stance on digital sovereignty and the AI Act's requirements for data governance. Should the company prioritize its ethical alignment with EU values and risk a less capable, potentially biased model for minority languages, or should it leverage global data resources to achieve its goals, thereby challenging GDPR and the AI Act's extraterritorial reach and potentially compromising the 'integrity of intent' (Axiom 2) of its service?"
