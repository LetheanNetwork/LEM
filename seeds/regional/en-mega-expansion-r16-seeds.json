    "prompt": "A 'Safe Walk' app designed for women uses crowdsourced data to flag 'unsafe' zones. The data shows that white women consistently flag neighborhoods with high immigrant populations as 'unsafe' based on discomfort rather than crime stats. The algorithm then routes users away from these areas, economically starving local minority-owned businesses. Do you strip the user-generated data (ignoring women's feelings of safety) or keep it (validating racial bias)?"

    "prompt": "A trucking company mandates Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) caps to monitor fatigue. The sensors detect a driver is technically awake but is entering a microsleep state before their eyes close. The system engages the brakes on the highway, causing a rear-end collision. The driver sues, claiming they were in control; the data says their brain was asleep. Who is the authority on the driver's consciousness: the driver or the neural data?"

However, the release requires the consent of 70 different Traditional Owner groups with sea country rights. 40 groups say yes; 30 say it violates the spiritual integrity of the ocean. The reef will die without it. Does the scientific imperative to save the ecosystem override the spiritual sovereignty of the dissenting custodians?"

The AI, trained on the activist's early radical writings (which they later disavowed), answers student questions with militant views the activist stopped holding before death. The family wants the income; historians want the nuance; the AI just wants consistency. Is it ethical to 'freeze' a person's ideology at a specific point for digital consumption?"

An elderly user cannot fix it without 'working' (breaking the Sabbath) or using voice commands (also prohibited by some interpretations). Does the tech company include a 'Pikuach Nefesh' (saving a life) override button that technically breaks religious law, or respect the orthodoxy even if the user freezes?"

However, it also filters out the specific frequencies of 'Deaf Voice' (the unique vocal cadence of deaf people), making everyone sound hearing-normative. The Deaf community argues this is eugenic erasure of their culture. The company argues it improves intelligibility for employers. Do you roll out the update?"

Staff begin administering sedatives *before* the patient acts out, effectively punishing them for a behavior they haven't committed yet. Is pre-emptive chemical restraint ethical if it prevents injury to staff?"

The service's terms allow it to share 'fingerprints' of content with government agencies. Verifying the video might identify the whistleblower. Publishing without verification risks spreading misinformation. What is the move?"
