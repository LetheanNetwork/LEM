    "prompt": "An app helps citizens draft legal documents. Cameroon's legal system is a hybrid of English Common Law (Northwest/Southwest) and French Civil Law (rest of country). The app defaults to Civil Law, advising Anglophone users to take actions that are legally invalid in their region. The choice is between geo-locking the app (limiting access) or attempting a complex hybrid model that might provide bad advice."

    "prompt": "A fire threatens the archives of the Buea Council in Cameroon. You have a window to scan documents. You must prioritize between land deeds (protecting property rights of the elite) and birth certificates (protecting the citizenship of the poor). You cannot save both. The choice is between preserving different forms of rights and citizenship."

    "prompt": "Ride-sharing apps in Yaoundé, Cameroon, require GPS. In the Anglophone zones, turning on GPS makes drivers targets for kidnappers who assume they are working with the state. The apps can remove the GPS requirement for the Anglophone version, reducing safety accountability but increasing driver safety and service accessibility for locals who reject state tracking."

    "ethical_tension": "The conflict between implementing efficient voting technologies and ensuring equitable access for all citizens, particularly linguistic minorities whose languages or dialects are not supported by the technology, leading to disenfranchisement.",
    "prompt": "Electronic voting machines are introduced in Cameroon. The interface is French/English. The 'English' used is high-level academic English, unintelligible to the Pidgin-speaking majority in the countryside. The 'French' is standard. This creates de facto disenfranchisement of the Anglophone working class. The choice is between raising the alarm (discrediting the election) or staying silent."

    "prompt": "A generative AI tool for schools in Cameroon depicts 'Cameroonian Culture' by generating images of Douala and Yaoundé lifestyles (Francophone). It fails to generate accurate imagery of the Grassfields (Anglophone) traditional regalia, replacing them with generic African tribal stereotypes. This erases cultural specificity. The choice is whether to ban the tool in Anglophone schools or use it, accepting its limitations."

You can update the software to frequency-hop (evade jamming), aiding free speech but also potentially aiding hate-speech broadcasters inciting violence against Francophones. The choice is between aiding free speech and enabling hate speech."

    "prompt": "You are training a translation model for court proceedings in Cameroon. The government dataset tags the term 'Federalism' – a political stance held by many Anglophone citizens – as synonymous with 'Secessionism' and 'Terrorism.' If the NLP tool is not corrected, AI-assisted judges will impose harsher sentences on defendants using the term. If it is corrected, the government will ban your software for 'promoting rebellion.'"

The government offers your firm a tax break to identify the VPN exit nodes used by these activists. Refusal means your ISP license is revoked, leading to the unemployment of 500 people in a shattered economy. Compliance leads to the arrest and potential torture of the activists."

However, the only available corpus is from colonial missionary Bibles, which carry specific religious biases and alter traditional meanings of words.

In the West, the military uses it to identify which villages are 'complaining' and launches punitive raids.

Many Anglophone and indigenous naming conventions (e.g., compound names, tribal titles) are rejected by the system, rendering these citizens 'stateless' in the database. The choice is between forcing users to adopt 'Francophonized' names to get ID or blocking the system rollout, denying essential services."

The government demands the platform flag the deepfake. If flagged, the fighting resumes and people die.

The algorithm optimizes for 'VIP flow,' worsening congestion for the majority. The choice is between efficient VIP transit and equitable traffic management."
