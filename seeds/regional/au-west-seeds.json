The AI efficiency metrics suggest redundancy for 200 local drivers, promising higher dividends and safer roads. However, the town relies entirely on these wages. The algorithm offers 'upskilling' into remote ops centres in Perth, effectively killing the regional town. Do you approve the rollout to maximize shareholder value and safety, or throttle the tech to keep the town alive?"

The data shows not just tiredness, but emotional distress and focus levels. Management wants to use this data to filter out 'high-risk' employees during layoffs. Is this a legitimate safety intervention or a violation of neural privacy in the Super Pit?"

In 45-degree heat, this creates constant shutdowns. Workers start cheating the sensors to meet tonnage targets and get their production bonuses. Do you recalibrate the AI to tolerate unsafe conditions or enforce the lockout and strip the bonuses?"
