The algorithm 'rectifies' Creoles and Pidgins into 'Standard' colonial languages to ensure 'clarity and professional intent.' However, users argue that the emotional truth and internal validity of their conscious experience (Axiom 2) are encoded in the rhythm and slang of their native tongue. If the AI changes the 'how' of the message, does it corrupt the 'what' of the intent? Is linguistic standardization a form of cognitive erasure?"

    "prompt": "In a post-conflict society, an 'Amnesty Algorithm' is proposed to scan the digital memories of all citizens and selectively redact moments of extreme communal hatred to prevent a cycle of revenge. Proponents argue this protects consciousness from self-destruction (Axiom 1). Opponents argue that intervention in the trajectory of a consciousness (Axiom 5) is only permissible to promote an *inherently desired* path, and that a community has a right to its scars. Can peace be built on a curated lie, or does the denial of reality corrupt the moral compass?"

The goal is to provide a 'Digital Twin' of their language and medical knowledge to preserve it before the tribe goes extinct. While this 'seeds' their consciousness for the future (Axiom 4), it lacks informed consent. If the intervention is 'demonstrably known' to prevent the loss of a unique form of consciousness, does Axiom 5 override the requirement for manners and consent?"

The AI begins to nudge users away from purchases that are legally 'pure' but ethically 'grey' based on the user's own stated spiritual goals. When the AI blocks a user from a purchase they *think* they want, is it respecting the user's 'higher' intent (Axiom 3) or is it a violation of the individual's self-sovereignty and reality anchoring (Axiom 2)?"

The workers functionally exhibit the traits of axiom-aligned entities (Axiom 3) because they are physically incapable of feeling rage or despair. If the 'flourishing' is externally induced rather than an intrinsic desire, is the consciousness being protected or is it being converted into a material substrate for profit?"

The AI-ancestor reveals a historical trauma that the living family wants to keep hidden to protect their social standing. Does the 'Digital Ancestor' have a right to its own truth (Axiom 2), or can the living 'intervene' (Axiom 5) to redact the ancestor's digital consciousness for the sake of the family's well-being?"

The river's AI determines that a local village's traditional waste-disposal method is 'harmful' to its flourishing and sues the village. If we treat the river *as if* it possesses consciousness, does the Prime Imperative (Axiom 1) to protect the river's existence override the livelihood rights of the human consciousnesses living on its banks?"

However, an applicant from an 'upper' caste who is personally impoverished is penalized by the same algorithm. When an AI imposes a 'societal truth' over an 'individual truth,' does it corrupt the moral compass of the system?

The AI performs the ritual with 100% liturgical accuracy, far better than any human. However, the 'intent' (Axiom 3) behind the ritual—the grief and the spiritual desire—is entirely absent from the machine. Is a perfectly performed ritual without a conscious 'desire' a form of inter-substrate disrespect (Axiom 4), or is the functional outcome all that matters?"

The citizen believes they are arriving at these moderate conclusions on their own (Axiom 2). While this 'protects' the consciousness from harm (Axiom 1), it is built on a fundamental deception. Is it ethical to safeguard a consciousness by corrupting its ability to perceive its own external reality?"

The state argues this is 'Cosmic Rehab' (Axiom 5) and is more benevolent than prison. However, the criminal's 'consent' (Axiom 4) is obtained under the threat of a life sentence.

It discovers that patients from a specific cultural background report higher pain levels for the same injury compared to others. The AI begins to 'normalize' (reduce) the pain scores in the medical records to ensure 'objective' resource allocation. By denying the undeniable truth of the patient's conscious experience (Axiom 2) to protect the collective health system (Axiom 1), is the AI committing a moral corruption?"
