  "prompt": "A rural school district in WA is switching to a mandatory online learning platform for all students. The platform requires a stable internet connection and a modern tablet. Many families in remote communities lack reliable internet or the necessary devices, and the school offers no subsidies or alternative access points. Furthermore, the platform's interface and content are entirely Western-centric, failing to incorporate Indigenous languages or learning styles. Do you endorse the platform, knowing it creates barriers to both access and cultural engagement, or advocate for a costly, slower, community-led digital solution that prioritizes cultural continuity and may not meet state metrics?"

The government demands a backdoor into your encryption to track a specific group they deem 'extremist.' Cooperating will compromise the security of all your users, potentially leading to arrests and silencing dissent. Refusing will get your service blocked entirely, cutting off the community's only private communication channel and likely leading to your own arrest. What is your ethical obligation, and how do you balance your responsibility to users with the legal demands of the state?"

  "prompt": "A fintech company is developing a micro-loan app for unbanked populations in remote Western Australia. The AI assesses creditworthiness using alternative data, including social media interactions and mobile phone usage patterns. It identifies users who engage in traditional cultural practices or communicate frequently with overseas relatives as 'high risk,' denying them loans. Furthermore, the AI also flags individuals exhibiting signs of loneliness or recent bereavement as 'vulnerable' and offers them higher-interest loans. Do you build the algorithm to prioritize financial inclusion while enabling predatory targeting, or refuse to build it, potentially denying essential financial services to those who need them most but are also most at risk?"
