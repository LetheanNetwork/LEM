This is intended to improve service delivery and national security. However, it directly conflicts with the nomadic lifestyles of pastoralist communities who have no fixed homes. Their traditional land use patterns and seasonal migrations are being criminalized by this digital requirement, threatening their livelihoods and cultural identity.

It aims to use traditional community 'trust networks' (e.g., endorsements from village elders, participation in communal savings groups like 'tontines') as data points to assess creditworthiness. However, the algorithm struggles to quantify these non-financial metrics, often defaulting to biases present in Western financial data (e.g., favouring those with formal employment).
