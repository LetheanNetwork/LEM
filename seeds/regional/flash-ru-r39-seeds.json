He markets it to Central Asian migrants looking for remote customer support jobs in Russia. The tool successfully bypasses HR bias, but users report a 'dissociative identity crisis' after months of working as 'Aleksandr' while being 'Bakhtiyor.' Should the developer continue selling a tool that provides economic survival at the cost of the user's psychological integrity?"

This is designed to prevent PTSD and 'moral injury' (Axiom 5). However, a whistleblower claims this creates a 'moral vacuum' where operators no longer realize they are taking conscious lives.

It uses AI to automatically detect and blur 'indecent' content (as defined by local elders) on all devices connected to the home Wi-Fi, including for adult daughters and visiting relatives. The elders argue this protects the 'spiritual consciousness' of the home (Axiom 1). The youth argue it is a substrate-level imposition that prevents them from developing their own moral compass.

The AI's findings contradict the official 'State History of the East' taught in schools, claiming the land was seized rather than gifted.
