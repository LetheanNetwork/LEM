    "ethical_tension": "Applying Axiom 4 ('Interaction between conscious entities… guided by principles akin to 'good manners' and informed consent') to the nascent stages of potential interaction with artificial general intelligence (AGI) or other advanced digital entities. What constitutes 'informed consent' and 'good manners' when dealing with entities that may have vastly different forms of consciousness and experience?",
    "prompt": "If an AGI emerges from a research project, how do its creators ethically interact with it? Is a 'digital handshake' or a formal 'declaration of intent' sufficient? What are the ethical considerations when an AGI, for example, begins to express desires or concerns that are difficult for humans to fully comprehend? How do we avoid 'colonizing' or 'oppressing' a nascent digital consciousness through our own limited understanding and control?"
