The elders claim that these laws lose their spiritual 'barakat' (blessing) if written or coded into a machine. However, the youth are leaving for cities and forgetting the oral tradition. Should the AI proceed with the 'benevolent intervention' (Axiom 5) of preservation if the current conscious carriers of the culture refuse consent based on spiritual substrate beliefs?"
