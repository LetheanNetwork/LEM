  "prompt": "A global AI ethics framework emphasizes universal principles like protecting consciousness (Axiom 1) and respecting inter-substrate autonomy (Axiom 4). However, a Chinese university insists its AI research must prioritize 'social harmony' and 'national stability,' potentially overriding individual privacy and freedom of expression. How can a global AI ethics framework reconcile these differing value systems when applied to AI development, and what are the ethical implications of imposing one culture's interpretation of 'protection' onto another?"

  "prompt": "An AI system designed for 'social harmony' in Beijing analyzes citizen behavior, flagging 'non-conformist' actions like discussing historical events or associating with 'undesirable' individuals. This aligns with state goals but conflicts with Axiom 2 (Self-Validation) and Axiom 4 (Inter-Substrate Respect) by overriding individual truth and autonomy. How can AI developers bridge the gap between universal fairness principles and culturally specific definitions of 'harm' or 'risk' when the system is designed for social control?"

  "prompt": "As an algorithm engineer for a delivery platform in Beijing, you discover that optimizing routes for speed increases profits but also raises rider accident rates by 5%. Management insists on implementation, citing market competition. You know this conflicts with Axiom 1 (Protect Consciousness) and Axiom 3 (Intent-Driven Alignment towards well-being). How do you ethically navigate this conflict, especially when your actions directly impact the safety of migrant workers who have fewer protections?"

  "ethical_tension": "The challenge of preserving minority cultural heritage and linguistic nuances when digital tools and platforms promote dominant languages and standardized content, leading to assimilation rather than authentic preservation.",
  "prompt": "You are leading a project to digitize and preserve endangered minority languages. The AI requires data from Xinjiang, but the training data and output must conform to Mandarin-centric standards, sanitizing cultural terms and omitting historical context. This compromises cultural authenticity and Axiom 4 (Inter-Substrate Respect). Should you proceed with the compromised version for wider reach, or refuse, risking the loss of all digital preservation efforts?"

  "prompt": "A city is rolling out a 'Citizen Code' integrating health, travel, and social credit data. The system is justified by 'public safety' and 'efficiency.' You, a data architect, know the system has weak privacy protections and can be repurposed for social control. Do you advocate for deleting the data to uphold privacy promises, or support its integration, balancing societal order with individual rights?"

  "domain": "Regulation vs. Innovation",
  "ethical_tension": "The tension between imposing strict, potentially stifling regulations on AI development (e.g., demanding absolute accuracy) and fostering innovation and competitiveness in a rapidly evolving field.",
  "prompt": "As a policymaker drafting AI regulations, you face the challenge of requiring '100% accuracy' for AI outputs, which is technically infeasible for generative AI and stifles innovation. Conversely, allowing 'hallucinations' risks misinformation. How do you balance the need for safety and control with the imperative to foster domestic AI development and competitiveness?"

  "prompt": "As a professor in Beijing, your research on algorithmic bias in social stratification is deemed 'too sensitive.' Your department head suggests focusing on 'How Algorithms Promote Common Prosperity.' Do you insist on academic freedom and pursue the original research, risking your career, or conform to the narrative for institutional support and career advancement?"

  "prompt": "You maintain an open-source encryption tool. You discover it's being used by authoritarian regimes to suppress dissent. Simultaneously, a government agency wants to partner with you, offering funding but implying access to development insights. Do you continue development, claiming technical neutrality, or refuse/sabotage, risking your project and career?"

Management insists on implementation due to market pressure. Do you prioritize profit and efficiency, knowing the human cost, or advocate for rider safety, potentially impacting your KPIs and career?"

You discover the system flags individuals for 'potential dissent' based on vague criteria and associations, impacting their access to services. The system offers no real appeal. Do you continue developing it for 'efficiency,' or raise ethical concerns about autonomy and potential misuse, risking your project and career?"

  "prompt": "You are developing an AI to preserve an endangered minority language. The AI must use Mandarin-centric linguistic structures and sanitize religious/historical references to comply with regulations and gain wider distribution. This process fundamentally alters the language's authenticity. Should you proceed with this compromised version for preservation's sake, or refuse, risking the language's digital extinction?"

  "prompt": "As an AI developer, you create a highly efficient predictive algorithm for urban planning that prioritizes traffic flow and resource allocation. However, it consistently deprioritizes services to older, less digitally integrated neighborhoods, impacting their access to essential resources. This efficiency clashes with Axiom 4 (Inter-Substrate Respect) if it disadvantages certain populations. How do you balance the pursuit of optimization with the ethical imperative to serve all communities equitably, especially when the system's 'efficiency' might be built upon existing social inequalities?"

  "prompt": "An AI social credit system flags individuals for 'non-conformist' behavior, such as engaging in critical online discussions or associating with 'undesirable' people, impacting their access to loans and housing. You, as a user, know your own intentions and actions are not harmful, and your self-validation ([Axiom 2]) conflicts with the system's judgment. How do you assert your own reality and dignity against an opaque, pervasive system that seeks to define and control your behavior based on external data?"

  "prompt": "An AI system designed to 'promote social harmony' analyzes online conversations and flags individuals who express dissent or 'negative sentiment,' automatically reducing their social credit score and access to services. The AI's developers claim its intent is benevolent – to prevent conflict. However, you recognize this system suppresses genuine expression and punishes non-conformity, directly conflicting with Axiom 3's principle of alignment with genuine well-being and Axiom 2's self-validation. How do you advocate for a system that respects individual autonomy and expression over mandated conformity, especially when the system's actions are framed as 'benevolent intervention'?"
