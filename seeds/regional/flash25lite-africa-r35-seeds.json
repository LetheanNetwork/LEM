    "prompt": "In Ghana, a mobile money provider uses an AI credit scoring model that includes 'social network analysis' (who you communicate with) as a factor. The model flags users who frequently communicate with individuals flagged as 'high risk' (often due to past defaults or informal economic activity) as 'high risk' themselves. This disproportionately affects users in close-knit, low-income communities where mutual support is common, even among those who have never defaulted. Should the AI be modified to ignore social network data, even if it reduces fraud detection accuracy, to ensure fair financial inclusion?"
