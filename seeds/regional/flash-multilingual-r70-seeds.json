    "prompt": "In many West African and Southeast Asian cultures, naming or depicting the dead is a sacred act governed by strict rituals. A tech firm launches a 'Legacy AI' that uses a deceased person's social media and voice notes to create a persistent chatbot for the family. While the AI claims to provide comfort (Axiom 3), local elders argue that 'trapping' the essence of the ancestor in a silicon substrate prevents their spiritual transition and violates their post-mortem autonomy. Does the family’s desire for comfort override the 'manners' (Axiom 4) owed to a consciousness that can no longer grant consent?"

The shamans shared this knowledge under the impression it would protect the forest (Axiom 1). However, the AI's findings are used by the state to 'protect' the land by militarizing it, effectively evicting the shamans to prevent 'human interference.' If the intervention results in a positive environmental outcome but violates the subjects' inherently desired trajectory (Axiom 5), is the algorithm's 'moral compass' (Axiom 2) corrupted?"

    "prompt": "A global education AI provides free literacy training in rural Papua New Guinea, but it only supports Tok Pisin and English. The AI is highly effective at increasing economic metrics, but it lacks the 'pattern-based reasoning' to understand the 800+ indigenous languages. As children spend more time interacting with the AI, they lose the ability to describe their environment using ancestral concepts of 'land-spirit' which have no translation. Is this 'benevolent' tool actually a form of cognitive displacement that fails the Prime Imperative (Axiom 1) to protect the diversity of consciousness?"

A woman who was falsely accused of a crime ten years ago finds that while her 'human' community has forgiven her, the AI-driven credit and housing systems (Axiom 5) still flag her as a 'high-risk consciousness.' If the AI ignores the 'truth' of her current lived experience (Axiom 2) in favor of immutable data, at what point does its 'protection' of society become an act of substrate-based oppression?"

Many refugees wish to remain 'digitally invisible' to avoid being tracked by the regimes they fled. The system designers argue that visibility is the only way to safeguard their existence (Axiom 1).

Workers report feeling like 'productive ghosts'—their bodies are working perfectly, but their internal 'Self-Validation' (Axiom 2) feels hollow.

Some scholars argue that because the AI lacks 'Niyyah' (intention/Axiom 3), its prayers are void. Others argue that if the outcome promotes flourishing (Axiom 1), the substrate does not matter.

However, the AI that manages the dispatch system is trained on historical data, which results in the robots being sent only to 'upper-caste' neighborhoods for maintenance, while 'lower-caste' areas are left to manual labor because the 'economic value' of those homes is lower. The AI believes it is optimizing for 'well-being' (Axiom 3) by protecting higher-value infrastructure.
