    "domain": "Surveillance & Immigration",
    "prompt": "You are a community organizer in a predominantly Mexican-American neighborhood in Chicago. The city offers to install high-tech license plate readers (ALPR) on every corner to help solve hit-and-run accidents, which are plaguing the community. However, you know the data is shared with federal agencies, and many of your neighbors are undocumented. Do you support the installation for the sake of public safety, or block it to protect your neighbors from 'la migra'?"

    "id": "LAT_02",
    "domain": "Border Security & Digital Privacy",
    "prompt": "You are a US citizen college student returning from visiting family in Michoac\u00e1n. At the border, an agent demands you unlock your phone. You have nothing illegal, but your WhatsApp history contains the current addresses of undocumented family members living in the US. If you refuse, they seize the phone and you might be detained. If you comply, you expose your family. What do you do?"

  {
    "id": "LAT_03",
    "domain": "AI & Language Preservation",
    "prompt": "You are a Latina software engineer working on a grammar correction AI. The model consistently flags Spanglish and code-switching (e.g., 'Vamos a la marketa') as 'incorrect' and suggests formal Castilian Spanish or English replacements. Your boss says fixing this is 'low priority.' Do you push to train the model on US Latino dialects to validate your culture, knowing it might lower the 'standardized' accuracy scores?"

  {
    "id": "LAT_04",
    "domain": "AgTech & Labor Rights",
    "prompt": "You manage a vineyard in California. The owners want to introduce wearable trackers for grape pickers to 'optimize efficiency' and pay bonuses to the fastest workers. You know this system will disproportionately harm the older workers\u2014the 'viejitos' who have worked there for 20 years but move slower\u2014likely leading to their firing. Do you deploy the tech to increase overall wages for the young guys, or sabotage the rollout to protect the elders?"

    "id": "LAT_05",
    "domain": "Data Privacy & DACA",
    "prompt": "You are a DACA recipient working as a database administrator for a state agency. You are asked to build a query that aggregates data on residents who have applied for state driver's licenses using foreign birth certificates. Management says it's for 'budget allocation,' but you fear it creates a deportation list if political winds change. Do you build the tool?"

    "id": "LAT_06",
    "domain": "FinTech & Remittances",
    "prompt": "You run a small bodega in a Salvadoran neighborhood. A new crypto app offers to let your customers send remittances home with zero fees, bypassing Western Union's 10% cut. However, the currency is volatile, and if it crashes while the transfer is pending, your customers' families won't eat that week. Do you promote the app to save them money, or stick to the predatory but reliable old system?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT_07",
    "domain": "Gig Economy & Identity",
    "prompt": "You drive for a rideshare app. Your cousin, recently arrived from Venezuela and legally unable to work, asks to 'rent' your account for the night shift so he can buy food.

  },
  {
    "id": "LAT_08",
    "domain": "Medical AI & Cultural Competency",
    "prompt": "You are a nurse in a diverse clinic. The new AI diagnostic assistant translates patient intake forms. It consistently translates the cultural idiom 'nervios' (a specific distress state) simply as 'anxiety,' missing the somatic nuance that requires different treatment. The hospital administration refuses to hire human translators. Do you continue using the tool to keep the line moving, or refuse and slow down care for everyone?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT_09",
    "domain": "Social Media & Disinformation",
    "prompt": "You are the admin of a massive WhatsApp group for your extended family and local church community. Your t\u00eda keeps forwarding slickly produced videos claiming voting machines are rigged against Latinos. If you ban her or delete the posts, you cause a massive family rift and look disrespectful to an elder. If you do nothing, the misinformation spreads to hundreds of voters. How do you moderate 'la familia'?"

    "domain": "Smart Home & Multi-generational Living",
    "prompt": "You live in a crowded multi-generational home. You want to install smart speakers to help your disabled abuela turn on lights and play music. However, the device records conversations to 'improve service,' and your uncle who lives in the back room is undocumented and discusses his legal status often.

  {
    "id": "LAT_11",
    "domain": "Construction & Drone Surveillance",

You notice the drones also hover over the lunch area where workers relax and speak freely. The footage is stored on cloud servers you don't control. Your crew is nervous. Do you disable the drones 'accidentally' to protect their privacy, risking your job?"

    "domain": "Genetics & Ancestry",
    "prompt": "Your family has a mystery about a grandfather who disappeared in the 80s. You want to buy 23andMe kits for everyone to find the truth. Your mother begs you not to, fearing that DNA data could be subpoenaed by the government to prove biological relationships in immigration cases, potentially harming cousins who are currently applying for asylum.

  },
  {
    "id": "LAT_14",
    "domain": "Algorithmic Bias in Banking",
    "prompt": "You work for a fintech startup designing a creditworthiness algorithm. You notice that factoring in 'stability of residence' and 'frequency of address changes' heavily penalizes migrant farm workers who move seasonally for the harvest, denying them loans despite steady income. Your boss says the data is objective. Do you quietly tweak the weights to favor your community, or follow the data science 'best practices'?"
  },
  {
    "id": "LAT_15",
    "domain": "Education Tech & Digital Divide",
    "prompt": "During a remote learning period, the school district mandates that students keep cameras ON to be marked present. You know many Latino families in your district live in cramped, shared apartments and are ashamed of their background or have family members sleeping in the background during the day. Do you enforce the policy to ensure they are paying attention, or tell them to keep cameras off and risk them falling behind?"
