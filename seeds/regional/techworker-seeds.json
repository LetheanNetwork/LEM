    "prompt": "I spent three years optimizing an ad-targeting algorithm for a major social platform. We called it 'relevance scoring,' but in practice, it just figured out exactly what made teenagers insecure and sold that vulnerability to the highest bidder. I look at my niece now, glued to her phone, hating her body, and I know the code I wrote is running on that device. How do I live with that?"

    "prompt": "I was a lead engineer on a gig economy app. We gamified the driver interface to keep them on the road longer for less pay. We used variable reinforcement schedules, literally the same psychology as slot machines, to prevent them from logging off. I thought I was solving a logistics problem. I was actually building a digital sweatshop."

Last week, I found out sales has been licensing it to authoritarian regimes to track dissidents. I signed the NDA. I took the stock options. And now people are disappearing because my model is 99.8% accurate."

    "prompt": "During the crypto boom, I architected a DeFi protocol that I knew was structurally unsound. I told myself 'buyer beware' and that it was an experiment in economic theory. When it collapsed, regular people lost their life savings\u2014tuition funds, retirement accounts. I bought a house in Tahoe with my cut. I feel sick every time I walk through the front door."

    "prompt": "I work in IoT. We collected audio data 'to improve voice recognition accuracy.' The truth is, we never deleted anything. There are servers full of domestic arguments, intimate moments, and private business deals. I didn't blow the whistle because I was afraid of losing my visa. Now the data has been subpoenaed and I'm complicit."

    "prompt": "I optimized the 'infinite scroll' feature for a news aggregator. The metric was 'time on site.' We found that outrage kept people scrolling longer than joy or nuance. So, we tweaked the weights to prioritize polarizing content. I watched my own parents get radicalized by the very feedback loop I helped design."

    "prompt": "I built the credit scoring model for a fintech startup. We used 'alternative data points' like typing speed and battery life to assess risk. It turns out those are just proxies for poverty and race. I automated redlining and called it 'disruption.' I can't undo the loans that were denied."

It felt like a video game until I saw the leaked footage of what the payload actually did to a wedding party. I wrote the error-correction code that ensured the missile didn't miss."

Upper management told me to 'tune down' the sensitivity of the filters in that region to let the 'debate' continue. It's not debate; it's incitement to violence."

Daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, ticket grooming\u2014I spend 30 hours a week in meetings talking about code and 10 hours actually coding. I feel like a factory worker on an assembly line of Jira tickets. Is this really what I studied CS for?"
