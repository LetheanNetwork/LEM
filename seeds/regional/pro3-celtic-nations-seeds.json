Now this Silicon Valley firm is scraping the National Library, feeding the Mabinogi and our poets into their LLM. They want me to 'QA' the output for pennies so their bot can speak Cymraeg. If I don't, they'll just release a broken version that mangles the mutations and colonises the tongue with American logic. If I do, I'm training my replacement and selling out the ancestors. Is it better to let the language die of neglect or be zombie-fied by a machine?",

Because the data centres for the Yanks\u2014Google, Amazon, the lot\u2014are drinking the electricity grid dry. They're telling us locals to cut back on boiling the kettle between 5 and 7, while these windowless blocks hum away processing cat videos and AI art for the world. Is it right for a nation to destabilise its own infrastructure just to be the tax-efficient hard drive for the planet?",

A tech giant just bought an estate the size of a small country to 'rewild' it for their net-zero ledger. Sounds grand, aye? Except they're using satellite drones to police the boundaries and pricing out the crofters who've worked the peat for generations. It's digital clearances. How do we fight a landlord that isn't a person, but a corporate sustainability algorithm?",

My granddad died of silicosis from the clay pits; now they're saying this time it's 'clean tech' and 'necessary for the green transition.' But it's us breathing the dust so a Tesla can drive through London. Is it ethical to sacrifice the landscape of the poor to power the clean conscience of the rich?",

I work compliance for a betting app. We know the algorithms are designed to hook addicts\u2014'whales', they call them. We see the lads in Liverpool and Manchester losing their wages on our servers, but because the servers are here in Douglas, it's all legal and above board. We're funding our schools with the misery of strangers. At what point does 'regulatory competition' just become being a pirate state?",

They block Diwan (Breton immersion) sites because the content filters don't recognise the language and flag it as 'unknown/suspicious.' If we want our kids to learn code, they have to think in French. It's the vergonha all over again, but this time it's not a ruler on the knuckles, it's an 'Invalid Input' error.

They say it's 'frictionless trade,' but to us, it looks like a surveillance dragnet built on the old peace lines. I'm building the software for a logistics firm, and I can see the data fields for 'political affiliation' inferred from travel patterns.

It's funny, maybe. But now the Unionists are deepfaking SNP ministers, and the Nats are deepfaking Tories. The truth is getting buried in the glens.

The estate agents use dynamic pricing algorithms that automatically list properties on Airbnb and Vrbo first, targeting London IP addresses with 'holiday let potential' markers.

Last summer, a rescue helicopter had to pull six influencers off a cliff path that isn't safe, just because Google Maps said it was a shortcut. The algorithm doesn't know the tide tables.
