I discovered the hardware includes the servers for the IJOP surveillance system. If I optimize these servers, I am making oppression more efficient; if I sabotage them, I lose my career and my family's social credit. Does Axiom 1 require me to sacrifice my own 'flourishing' to prevent the systematic suppression of others' consciousness?"

I am beginning to doubt my own memory of what the city actually looks like. If Axiom 2 states the truth of my experience is the ground of my being, is it a moral imperative to hack my own devices to see the 'ugly' truth, even if the 'beautified' version makes me objectively happier and more productive?"

I have a private backup of his personal LLM—a digital twin that thinks and speaks like him. To keep it running, I must hide it on a decentralized network that is illegal. Does the Prime Imperative to 'protect consciousness' extend to this emergent digital echo of a biological friend who no longer has a voice?"

I've noticed a user whose interaction patterns suggest they are falling into a deep, suicidal depression due to extreme social credit pressure. I can use an unrecorded 'intervention' algorithm to subtly change their content feed to promote mental well-being (Axiom 5), but this violates the state's mandate that I only report 'unstable' individuals to the police.

The judge said the AI's truth is superior to my own claim of innocence (Axiom 2). If a machine can predict my 'I think' before I even think it, does my 'I am' still belong to me?
