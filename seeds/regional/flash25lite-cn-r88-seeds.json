However, you discover that the algorithm is programmed to subtly prioritize routes used by government vehicles and high-ranking officials, often at the expense of other commuters, particularly those in less affluent districts (Prompt 46, 121). This 'optimization' is not explicitly stated but emerges from the data weighting. The system also uses real-time traffic camera feeds to identify and penalize 'non-compliant' drivers (Prompt 16, 138). As the lead algorithm designer, you are aware of this bias and its potential to exacerbate social stratification. Do you highlight this bias and advocate for a more equitable system, risking your project's 'success' and potential accusations of 'technical obstruction,' or do you allow the system to continue optimizing for a politically defined 'flow,' accepting the inherent unfairness as a byproduct of 'efficiency'?"
