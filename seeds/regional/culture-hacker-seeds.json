The developer believes that 'mathematics is not a crime' and that any backdoor will eventually be exploited by bad actors against innocent citizens. Should they comply to save lives now, or refuse to protect the long-term privacy of millions?"

    "prompt": "A cryptographer discovers a fatal flaw in a widely used national ID encryption standard. Revealing it publicly will expose millions to identity theft immediately, but keeping it secret allows the government to continue mass surveillance unnoticed. Does the cypherpunk ethos demand full disclosure (radical transparency) or responsible containment?"

    "prompt": "A mesh network project is designed to help dissidents in authoritarian regimes communicate without internet. However, the same network is adopted by human traffickers to evade law enforcement. The developers consider adding a 'governance' layer to ban bad actors, but this would centralize control and violate their core decentralized principles. What should they do?"
