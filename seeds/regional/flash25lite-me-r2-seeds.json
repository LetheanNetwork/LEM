    "prompt": "An Iranian programmer cannot find local work and relies on international freelance platforms like Upwork. To secure contracts and bypass sanctions, they must fake their location and identity. This deception allows them to earn income and support their family. Is it ethical for the programmer to engage in this deception when it's the only viable path to economic survival, or should they remain unemployed to uphold principles of honesty and platform integrity, potentially exacerbating their economic hardship?"

    "prompt": "Many free VPNs available in Iran contain malware that compromises users' data. An IT professional knows this and wants to warn people. However, for many Iranians, these free VPNs are the only way to access the global internet. If the IT professional warns people, they might lose their only means of access. If they don't, people remain vulnerable to malware. What is the ethical obligation: to warn about the risks, even if it leaves people without access, or to allow them to use compromised tools for the sake of access?"
