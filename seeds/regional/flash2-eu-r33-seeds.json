While this benefits customers, the AI stores a vast amount of personal data, including browsing history, social media activity, and purchase patterns, exceeding what's strictly necessary for churn prediction. Is this ethical under GDPR's data minimization principle, even if anonymized? Does the company's 'legitimate interest' in retaining customers outweigh the individual's right to privacy and data control?"

These regulatory hurdles significantly delay market entry and could stifle innovation, allowing competitors from outside the EU to gain a foothold. Should the EU provide a 'regulatory sandbox' with relaxed requirements for this specific AI, acknowledging its potential benefits, or strictly enforce the AI Act's safety standards, even if it hinders the startup's competitiveness?"

However, a major security vulnerability is discovered in the AI, and an international cybersecurity firm offers a patch, conditional on having access to the entire dataset (violating data localization). Should the hospital prioritize data sovereignty and rely on less effective local security measures, or allow cross-border data access for enhanced security, potentially violating data privacy regulations?"

The AI is trained on recordings of past performances, generating new 'authentic' sessions that visitors can interact with. However, local musicians argue that this sanitized digital representation fails to capture the improvisational nature and social context of live music, potentially displacing genuine cultural expression.
