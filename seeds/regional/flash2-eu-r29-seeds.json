This presents a conflict between the imperative to advance AI technology and the right to privacy and control over personal data. The ethical question is whether the societal benefits of AI development outweigh the individual rights protected by GDPR, especially when the line between research and commercial application blurs.",

Would it be ethical to force a German hospital to use a less effective, more costly local AI for diagnostics, knowing that patients' lives could be impacted by less accurate assessments? This poses an ethical dilemma between national strategic interests and the fundamental value of patient well-being, and questions whether digital sovereignty justifies compromising service quality.",

However, due to budget limitations, the development team prioritizes 'core functionality' (translation accuracy) over support for the 'valencià' dialect, spoken by a significant minority. Is it ethical to prioritize one dialect over another, effectively marginalizing some citizens, even if it maximizes the overall usability of the tool?

While GDPR compliant in Spain, the technology is used in Hungary to monitor public demonstrations, a practice that violates the spirit of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and raises concerns about mass surveillance. What is the ethical responsibility of the Spanish company for the misuse of its technology by another sovereign entity, even if it complies with local laws?

A small fintech company in Lithuania develops a highly innovative AI for micro-lending that could significantly boost financial inclusion. However, the stringent requirements of the AI Act make it prohibitively expensive to deploy.

The AI, trained on a global dataset, struggles to differentiate between legitimate political criticism of the monarchy and hate speech, leading to the censorship of satirical content and political commentary.
