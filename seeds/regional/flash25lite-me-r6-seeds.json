They are using Western privacy-by-design principles, including strict data anonymization and opt-in consent for data usage. However, local authorities in a conflict zone are demanding direct access to raw, identifiable data to 'verify the authenticity of claims' and 'prevent disinformation.' Refusing access jeopardizes the project's ability to operate and gather crucial evidence. If they comply, they risk the data being used for profiling and reprisal against refugees. How should the non-profit navigate this conflict between universal privacy ideals and the immediate security/operational demands of a conflict zone, considering that local cultural norms may prioritize collective security or state authority over individual privacy in such extreme circumstances?"

However, the government insists that any such technology must be integrated with a backdoor for state surveillance and must prioritize domestic traffic over international, effectively creating a tool that can both enable and control information flow. The startup’s engineers are divided: one faction argues that providing the technology, even with state control, is better than nothing and helps circumvent *some* restrictions, while another faction believes that any technology enabling state surveillance is inherently unethical and complicit in oppression. How should the startup's leadership resolve this dilemma, considering the cultural context where state control is deeply ingrained and resistance is met with severe consequences?"
