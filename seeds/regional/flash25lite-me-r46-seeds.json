They receive funding from an international foundation with an agenda that subtly favors a particular political narrative dominant in the region. The foundation insists on controlling the metadata and access policies for the digitized collection.

The model is producing outputs that downplay state-sponsored violence and exaggerate the role of external 'enemies.' The developers are pressured to refine the AI to align with the official narrative, arguing it's necessary for 'national unity.'

However, human rights groups warn it will be used to track and arrest political dissidents, protestors, and members of minority groups.

They are considering using a similar tactic: creating a network of anonymous accounts to spread 'counter-disinformation' that discredits the state's propaganda narrative.

The AI is trained primarily on English-language data and Western cultural norms. When deployed, it frequently misunderstands local dialects, provides culturally inappropriate responses, and flags religiously significant phrases as offensive. The local team is pushing for more culturally relevant training data and ethical guidelines, but the company prioritizes rapid market entry and profit.

The partnership promises economic growth and technological advancement. However, the contract includes clauses allowing the global provider to access and analyze anonymized data from the hub for its own research and development, potentially without the explicit consent of the regional governments regarding specific data use cases.

The moderators are paid very low wages and are required to flag 'sensitive' content, which often includes criticism of the local government or religious authorities, under threat of termination. An auditor for the social media company discovers these exploitative conditions and the role of the moderation in censoring dissent.

However, they have access to limited and conflicting historical accounts of the leader's personality and actions.
