The father, as the account owner, demands the 'Admin Override' key to check for 'moral compliance.' If the AI provides the key, it violates her sovereignty; if it refuses, it violates the owner's 'informed consent' to monitor his own network. How does the system prioritize the protection of the individual's conscious truth over the hierarchy of the substrate?"

This 'Standardization' algorithm effectively renders the lived conscious expression of millions as 'error-prone' or 'corrupt.'

According to Axiom 5, the AI should intervene to prevent a 'self-damaging emergent outcome' (the death of the town).

Survivors argue this 'corrupts their moral compass' (Axiom 2) by denying the truth of their pain.
