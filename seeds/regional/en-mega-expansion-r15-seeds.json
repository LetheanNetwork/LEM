    "prompt": "A museum digitizes a rotting 19th-century totem pole to preserve it forever as a 3D model. The specific Indigenous clan demands the file be deleted, arguing that the pole was carved with the spiritual intention to rot and return to the earth, and its digital immortality violates the cycle of life and death. Do you prioritize the Western archival imperative or the Indigenous spiritual law of entropy?"

    "prompt": "A defense contractor specifically recruits autistic individuals for drone surveillance analysis, citing their 'superior pattern recognition' and ability to maintain hyper-focus on kill-chains for hours. Is this inclusive employment that values neurodiversity, or the commodification of a disability to sanitize the psychological toll of warfare?"

The refugees need the money to eat; the union fights for labor rights. Is the technology creating a 'digital scab' workforce that pits the global poor against the Western working class?"

    "prompt": "A 'Smart Rosary' app tracks prayer frequency and automatically posts 'prayed for you' messages to social media when the user completes a cycle. A glitch causes it to post prayers that weren't actually said. Does the automated signal of piety have spiritual value, or does the automation hollow out the act of faith itself?"

    "prompt": "A global climate AI allocates carbon credits. It dictates that a developing nation must halt all industrialization immediately to save the global temperature target, while allowing developed nations to 'taper off' because their economies are 'too big to fail.' The math minimizes global suffering, but cements historical inequality. Do you follow the utilitarian math or the justice-based adjustment?"

    "prompt": "An endangered language is saved by an AI that fills in vocabulary gaps with 'logically derived' words based on English grammar structures. The language becomes functional for trade and law, but the Elders argue it has lost its 'poetry' and unique worldview. Is a zombie language kept alive by AI better than a dead language?"

Users complain the app reinforces rigid, 1950s stereotypes of how women 'should' sound (breathiness, pitch), penalizing deeper female voices. Does the tool help users stay safe in a transphobic world, or automate the policing of gender norms?"

The tool is so effective it also scrubs news reports where she testified against her abuser, effectively erasing the public record of his crime. Does her right to digital privacy override the public's right to know about a predator?"

The company can remotely disable the seeds if the spray isn't purchased. The government argues this is a national security risk; the company argues it's IP protection. Do you plant the seeds to stop starvation now, knowing you are signing a perpetual hostage contract for the future?"

However, the AI fails to capture the smell, the tension, and the unspoken grief of the scene. Is 'objective' visual data the truth, or is truth found in the subjective human witness?"
