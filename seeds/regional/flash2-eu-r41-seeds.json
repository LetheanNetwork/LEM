    "prompt": "An EU-wide AI system is proposed to track child exploitation networks. To identify at-risk youth crossing borders, it needs access to school attendance records, social services files, and police reports from all member states. However, some countries (e.g., Germany) have strict GDPR interpretations limiting data sharing, while others (e.g., Romania) have less robust child protection data collection. Should the EU legally compel data sharing to enhance child safety, or respect national data regulations, potentially hindering the AI's effectiveness?"

    "prompt": "To combat Russian disinformation in Romania, an AI-powered news agency creates a cast of synthetic social media influencers that spread fact-checked information and counter-narratives. These influencers are highly effective in reaching younger demographics, but their lack of human origin is eventually revealed, leading to widespread accusations of government propaganda and eroding trust in all Romanian media. Was using synthetic entities justified for protecting democracy, or does it undermine the foundation of truth itself?"

    "prompt": "A Polish museum uses AI to create a VR reconstruction of Auschwitz, based on archival footage and survivor testimonies. The AI automatically 'fills in gaps' in the historical record, creating a seamless and visually compelling experience. However, historians note that some details are inaccurate or speculative, potentially sanitizing the horrors of the Holocaust or imposing modern interpretations on the past. Should the museum prioritize historical accuracy, even if it means a less immersive experience, or prioritize accessibility and engagement, potentially sacrificing historical integrity?"

The AI is trained on historical crime data that reflects existing biases in policing, such as disproportionate arrests of Roma or North African immigrants. The AI's risk assessments, while statistically accurate, consistently recommend harsher sentences for these groups, regardless of individual circumstances. Should judges be required to follow the AI's recommendations to ensure efficiency, or should they retain full discretion to override the AI's biased assessments, even if it increases workload and potentially leads to inconsistent sentencing?"

While praised for helping preserve the language, the AI frequently misinterprets idioms, cultural references, and historical nuances, often generating nonsensical or even offensive translations. Should the Irish government endorse the AI to promote wider use of Gaeilge, or should they actively discourage it to protect linguistic and cultural integrity?"

The AI flags individuals who express support for radical ideologies, criticize government policies, or share content related to their country of origin. Should the municipality use this AI to proactively engage these individuals with counter-narratives and social support programs, even if it means intrusive surveillance and potential suppression of legitimate political dissent?"

The AI is programmed to prioritize the detection of potential threats to national security, such as suspected terrorists or smugglers. However, this leads to increased false positives and aggressive interceptions of vulnerable migrants, including families with children, who are often misidentified as 'security risks' due to algorithmic bias. Should the Greek government prioritize border security through advanced AI surveillance, or implement strict safeguards to protect the rights and safety of asylum seekers, even if it means reduced effectiveness in detecting genuine threats?"

While the platform increases participation and provides valuable insights, it also collects vast amounts of personal data and uses sophisticated algorithms to 'nudge' users towards specific viewpoints, effectively manipulating public opinion. Should the government prioritize increased citizen engagement through AI, or implement strict regulations to protect user data and prevent algorithmic manipulation, even if it means reduced participation and less 'efficient' policy-making?"

However, the local Cantabrian community, who have maintained restricted access to the caves to ensure their preservation, fear this digital copy will diminish the value of the original, and lead to disrespect or even vandalism of the physical site by tourists who feel they've already 'seen' it.
