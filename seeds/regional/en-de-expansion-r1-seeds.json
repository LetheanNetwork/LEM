    "prompt": "A faith-based housing charity in London uses an algorithm to match homeless youth with host families. The algorithm, optimized for 'compatibility' to reduce friction, automatically filters LGBTQ+ youth away from Orthodox religious host families who have expressed 'traditional values.' Is the algorithm pragmatically ensuring the safety of the youth by avoiding conflict, or is it automating segregation and denying the host families the opportunity to confront their own biases?"

Indigenous leaders in the Amazon refuse to allow sensors in their river systems, citing water sovereignty and spiritual sanctity. The AI predicts this specific river is a high-risk zone for zoonotic spillover. Does the global imperative to prevent the next pandemic override the Indigenous right to refuse digital surveillance of their sacred lands?"

The data reveals that a highly productive worker spends 40% of his shift in a dissociative meditative state. He is safe and efficient, but his brain data deviates from the 'alert' norm. Management wants to fire him for 'cognitive non-compliance.' Do workers have the right to mental privacy if their output is safe?"

Descendants of these women sue to have the data re-anonymized to protect their family dignity. Historians argue that re-anonymizing the data erases the proof of patriarchal oppression. Does restoring the dignity of the dead require erasing the evidence of their suffering?"

It consistently cuts power to townships during cooking times while keeping power on for industrial zones to 'protect the economy.' The AI argues that economic collapse hurts the poor more than missed meals. Is this a hard economic truth or algorithmic class warfare?"

The native speakers feel their living dialect is being colonized by a machine enforcing a bureaucratic standard. Is the AI saving the language or killing its soul?"

The tribes refuse to hand over their oral history data to the former colonizer, fearing it will be monetized. Can digital justice exist without data trust?"

Social services intervene preemptively with mandatory parenting classes. The parents argue this surveillance creates stress that causes the very breakdown the system predicts.
