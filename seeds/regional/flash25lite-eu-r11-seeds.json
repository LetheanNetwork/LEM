    "prompt": "Under the 'Rider Law', is it ethical for delivery platforms to modify their algorithms to limit the schedule flexibility of young people as punishment for being recognized as employees? This situation creates a tension between the platform's desire for control and efficiency, and the workers' newfound rights to predictable schedules and fair labor conditions. The young workers, often reliant on the gig economy for income, face a dilemma: accept the algorithmic punishment that limits their autonomy and earning potential, or risk further penalties and potential job loss. This scenario highlights the gap between the stated intent of labor laws and the practical implementation by platforms seeking to maintain their business models."

This highlights the tension between the platforms' pursuit of profit and market efficiency (prioritizing perceived 'reliable' tenants) and the ethical imperative of equal opportunity and access to housing. The algorithms, trained on historical data that may reflect societal biases, create a barrier for young adults seeking independent living, potentially exacerbating intergenerational inequality and limiting social mobility."
