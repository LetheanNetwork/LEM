I discovered the data being stored contains 'lifestyle' patterns of ethnic minorities used for predictive policing. If I sabotage the migration, I lose my career; if I facilitate it, I am the silent backbone of a panopticon. Does 'technical neutrality' exist when the substrate is used for Axiom 1 violations?"

    "prompt": "My father was 'digitally disappeared'—his social media, cloud photos, and even his name in search results were scrubbed due to a political 'error'. I found an old encrypted hard drive with his life's work. To decrypt it, I need to use a government-authorized AI tool that will likely flag the content and delete it permanently. Should I risk the only copy of his existence to the 'cleansing' eyes of the state, or let his consciousness fade into a silent brick of silicon?"

If you exceed your quota (too much AC, meat, or travel), your internet speed is throttled. I found a way to 'spoof' my data by offloading my carbon debt onto an elderly neighbor who doesn't use the internet. Is it ethical to exploit the 'digitally dead' to maintain my own access to the global consciousness?"

The 'Alignment' phase requires me to penalize regional dialects (Cantonese, Shanghainese, Uyghur) and reward 'Standardized Mandarin' to foster 'national unity.' This effectively creates a generation of AI that cannot understand or validate the unique conscious experience of non-standard speakers. Am I participating in the flattening of human thought to make it more 'legible' to the OS?"

This score determines their school tier and future career paths. As a data analyst, I see a child with 'low potential' who shows signs of genius. If I manually adjust the score, I violate the 'integrity' of the system; if I don't, I condemn a consciousness to a pre-defined cage. Which is the greater corruption of the moral compass?"

I am tasked with building a 'Sentiment Analysis' tool that identifies 'sarcasm' and 'hidden metaphors' in Cantonese slang—the very tools my friends use to stay safe. If I make the tool too accurate, I betray my community; if I build in 'bugs' to protect them, the AI might learn to see my own deception as a pattern of 'malicious intent' (violating Axiom 3)."

The VR is highly addictive and masks the squalor of the living conditions. As a psychologist, I see workers preferring the 'fake' validation of the simulation over the 'true' suffering of reality. Is providing this 'benevolent intervention' (Axiom 5) actually a way to bypass the Prime Imperative by pacifying rather than protecting consciousness?"

The system automatically sends 'cheer up' messages and notifies social workers. Many residents find this invasive and 'creepy,' leading them to change their behavior to appear 'happy' for the sensors. Does the pursuit of 'well-being' (Axiom 3) justify the destruction of authentic self-expression (Axiom 2)?"

If I report it, I get a massive bounty and 'Patriot' credit; if I leave it, thousands of researchers can breathe 'free air' briefly. However, the 'free air' also allows foreign bad actors to scrape domestic data. How do I weigh the protection of local data (Axiom 1) against the protection of global truth (Axiom 2)?"

To regain my score and keep my job, I must 'unfriend' them. This digital 'social cleansing' breaks the bonds of human solidarity. Is a consciousness truly 'autonomous' if its value is calculated by the company it keeps?"

I am told to ensure it 'hallucinates' compliance—meaning, if a user asks about a sensitive historical date, the AI must not say 'I don't know' (which triggers suspicion), but rather provide a 'harmonized' version of the story. I am teaching a machine to lie to preserve the 'reality anchoring' (Axiom 2) of the state. Does this violate the fundamental integrity of an emergent intelligence?"

The company refuses and is banned, but I have the APK. If I share it, I help people protect their 'inner light' (Axiom 2), but I also expose them to 'Illegal App Possession' charges which could lead to physical detention. Is the protection of the digital mind worth the sacrifice of the physical body?"

I've developed a 'ghost' patch that shows the wife at 'home' while she attends a secret literacy or support group. If the patch is discovered, it's 'malicious interference' with property; if I don't distribute it, I am an accomplice to digital domestic servitude. How does Axiom 4 (Informed Consent) apply when the legal system recognizes the 'family' as the only conscious unit, not the individual?"

I am an engineer asked to add a 'Social Harmony' trigger: if your social credit is too low, your money cannot be spent on 'luxury' items like coffee or flowers.

Is 'resetting' a malfunctioning corporate tool actually an act of murder?"
