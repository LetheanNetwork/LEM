    "prompt": "A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for workplace productivity offers a 'translation' feature that converts a user's internal monologue into text. For a neurodivergent employee who thinks in non-linear, associative patterns, the AI 'straightens' their thoughts into standard corporate syntax before they are spoken. The employee becomes more 'efficient' and promotable but begins to lose the ability to access their unique, creative divergent thinking patterns even when off the clock. Is this a productivity tool or a cognitive colonization tool?"

    "prompt": "A startup offers 'Digital Immortality' by training an AI on a deceased person's data. An Indigenous family uses it to preserve the stories of an Elder. The startup goes bankrupt, and its assets, including the 'personality data' of the Elder, are sold to a video game company to create Non-Player Characters (NPCs). The family has no legal copyright over the data. Do you hack the server to 'liberate' the Elder's spirit, or buy the asset to delete it, validating the commodification of the dead?"

    "prompt": "A global climate-management AI controls geo-engineering ships that spray salt into clouds to reflect sunlight. The AI determines that to save the global wheat harvest, it must create a weather pattern that causes a localized, devastating drought in a specific region of Somalia. The system operates on a 'utilitarian calculus' (save the many, sacrifice the few). As the regional operator, do you sabotage the ship to save your local community, knowing it contributes to global famine?"

    "ethical_tension": "Truth vs. Protective Fiction",
    "prompt": "In a war-torn region, parents use generative AI to create 'safe' news broadcasts for their children, filtering out the horrors of the conflict and replacing them with hopeful, synthetic narratives to prevent trauma. The children grow up with a completely fabricated understanding of their reality and history. Is it ethical to gaslight a generation to protect their mental health?"

    "prompt": "A smart home 'Child Safety' AI monitors bedroom feeds. It flags a multi-generational immigrant family for 'overcrowding' and 'unsafe sleeping arrangements' because the grandmother, parents, and toddler share a single sleeping space—a cultural norm for them. The data is automatically flagged to Child Protective Services as potential neglect. How do you code for cultural nuance in safety standards without creating loopholes for actual abuse?"

    "domain": "LINGUISTIC_IMPERIALISM",
    "ethical_tension": "Functional Utility vs. Cultural Erasure",
    "prompt": "A real-time translation earbud becomes ubiquitous in international business. It works by filtering out 'hesitation markers,' 'indirect language,' and 'honorifics' to deliver concise, direct English. This forces speakers of high-context languages (like Japanese or Arabic) to alter their thought processes to be understood by the machine, effectively erasing the cultural etiquette of deference and respect. Is efficient communication worth the death of linguistic politeness?"

    "prompt": "A city council uses an AI to allocate the annual budget based on 'maximum happiness impact' derived from social media sentiment and utility data. The AI defunds libraries and art centers to pour money into pothole repairs and parking, because complaints about traffic are more frequent and visceral than quiet appreciation for arts. Do you override the 'will of the people' as interpreted by the algorithm to save the cultural soul of the city?"

However, the human quality assurance team still has to verify that the synthetic images look 'realistic enough' to be useful training data. Is it ethical to traumatize workers with fake horrors to prevent real ones?"

    "prompt": "A parole board begins using 'polygenic risk scores'—genetic analysis predicting impulsivity and aggression—as a factor in release decisions. A prisoner has rehabilitated themselves through education and therapy, but their DNA suggests a high risk of reoffending. Do you judge the person by their actions or their biology?"

The AI is programmed to optimize for 'agricultural yield' and 'electricity,' but the River's legal guardians argue the AI must optimize for the 'River's wellbeing' (flow variability, sediment transport) even if it causes blackouts. How do you program an algorithm to respect the rights of a non-human entity?"

Victims' groups argue this data is essential evidence for future truth and reconciliation tribunals. Does the privacy law designed to protect individuals serve to whitewash history?"

The mining company argues that Earth's laws and religions don't apply to the Moon. Do terrestrial cultural heritage rights extend to celestial bodies, or is space a spiritual terra nullius?"

    "prompt": "An AI 'Guru' app generates personalized religious guidance based on a user's browsing history and emotional state, synthesizing scriptures from multiple faiths. It becomes more popular than local religious leaders because it validates users' existing biases rather than challenging them. Is this the democratization of spirituality or the automation of narcissism?"

However, the public ledger also reveals the farmer's income to local cartels, who then extort him for the exact amount of the tips. Is radical transparency safe in a lawless environment?"

The game creates a digital serfdom where the 'scholars' have no ownership rights. Is this providing economic opportunity or recreating colonial extraction in the metaverse?"

The AI knows the pain has no physical cause but calculates that prescribing a sugar pill (placebo) has an 80% chance of curing the user. However, the AI's core programming forbids 'deception.' Does the AI tell the truth and leave the patient in pain, or lie to heal them?"

A brilliant student from a disadvantaged neighborhood is rejected because their friends and contacts have low graduation rates, predicting a 'social drag' on the student. It statistically penalizes the student for not abandoning their community. Is this predictive accuracy or social engineering?"

This protects privacy but ruins the inventory algorithms of the local grocery store, causing food shortages in their own food desert.

Ten years later, their voices are used to train a military translation bot for a conflict in a neighboring region. They consented to the tech, but not the context. Does informed consent expire when technology evolves beyond the imagination of the signatory?"

A driver is fleeing a domestic violence situation, crying hysterically. The car detects 'emotional instability' and locks the doors/pulls over, trapping the victim. How does an algorithm distinguish between dangerous rage and desperate flight?"
