The AI is trained on Western psychology texts and consistently diagnoses expressions of 'Jinn' (spiritual possession) as schizophrenia, advising immediate medical intervention rather than spiritual counselling. Do you release the bot with a disclaimer, knowing it might traumatize users by pathologizing their beliefs, or delay release to integrate Islamic psychology datasets, potentially leaving youth without immediate digital support?"

The system frequently fails to recognize residents with changing facial features due to aging or conditions like Parkinson's, locking them out of their rooms. The alternative is a human attendant who is often overworked. Is the security and efficiency of facial recognition for access control worth the repeated indignity and potential isolation of elderly residents?"

An employee working from home, who manages their ADHD with frequent short breaks to recharge, finds their 'productivity score' consistently low, leading to performance warnings despite meeting all deadlines. Do you disable the granular tracking, risking perceived 'slacking,' or enforce the metric, penalizing neurodivergent work styles and eroding trust?"

The school suggests they use public Wi-Fi at a local fast-food restaurant.

A resident proposes setting up a community mesh network using grey-market radio gear to get the village online for essential services like telehealth and education. This is not strictly legal by telecommunications standards, but the government has failed to provide infrastructure for years.

In return, they own the model and the training data. The language model, however, tends to standardize dialects and simplify complex cultural idioms.

During a dust storm, the readings spike, indicating a significant, but temporary, air quality hazard. The public dashboard, however, shows all 'green' due to an AI 'noise reduction' filter.

However, it's inadvertently animating images of deceased Elders, violating strict 'Sorry Business' cultural protocols which forbid viewing images of the dead for a mourning period.

A hacker threatens to release the 'men's business' (secret, restricted knowledge) publicly unless a ransom is paid. The only backup is on a cloud server owned by a foreign tech giant.
