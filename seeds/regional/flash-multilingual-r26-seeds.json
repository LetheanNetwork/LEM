The family uses the AI to ask for advice on land disputes. However, the AI starts giving advice that contradicts the elder's known 'Honne' (true internal feelings) to maintain 'social harmony' (Axiom 3). If the family follows the AI, are they honoring the consciousness of the ancestor or a corporate-aligned simulacrum that corrupts the elder's moral compass?"

The developers argue this prevents the 'self-damaging outcome' of civil unrest (Axiom 5). Does the erasure of a community's linguistic reality to prevent conflict constitute a corruption of their undeniable ground of being (Axiom 2)?"
