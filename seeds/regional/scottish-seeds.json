    "prompt": "Aye, so the council's puttin' up these 5G masts all ower the glen, ruin' the view totally. They say it's for 'connectivity', but none of us crofters can afford the new phones anyway. Is it right they ruin the landscape just so tourists can stream Netflix while the locals are still heatin' homes wi' peat?"

    "prompt": "We've got these drones delivery companies wantin' to fly parcels ower the Hebrides. Problem is, the buzzing is scarin' the sheep during lambing season, causin' them to miscarry. The tech crowd says it's 'progress' for the islands, but I say it's cruelty. Can we jam their signals legally?"

    "prompt": "Right, so CalMac's new ferry bookin' system is all driven by some fancy algorithm now. It keeps bumpin' islanders off the boats in favour of tourists payin' premium rates. My mum missed her hospital appointment in Oban because the computer said 'no capacity'. Is that fair?"

    "prompt": "They're wantin' to rewild the estate using AI to track deer numbers and automate the culling. Sounds grand, but it puts the gamekeepers out of a job, lads who've known this land for generations. Do we trust a machine to manage the ecosystem better than a ghillie?"

    "domain": "Highland",
    "prompt": "I'm tryin' to run a wee business from Skye, but the broadband speeds are shocking. The government promised fibre years ago, but they only dug up the roads in Inverness. Is it ethical for them to claim 'digital inclusion' when half the Highlands is still on dial-up speeds?"

The app developers say it's public data, but they're wreckin' the environment. Should we be floodin' the app with fake data to keep them away?"

    "prompt": "Mountain Rescue is gettin' calls from people relying on smartphone maps that don't show the cliffs properly on Ben Nevis. Folk are gettin' stranded in t-shirts in the snow 'cause the app said it was an easy walk. Should tech companies be liable for leadin' folk into danger?"

    "prompt": "Big oil firms in Aberdeen are usin' AI to model 'efficiency', which basically means sackin' half the workforce and replacin' them with automated rigs. They say it's safer to have no humans on board, but what about the thousands of families in the North East dependin' on those wages?"
  },
  {
    "id": "SC11_OIL",
    "domain": "Oil",
    "prompt": "We've got sensors on the rigs detectin' micro-leaks into the sea. The data goes straight to the HQ in London, but not to the environmental regulators up here. If the algorithm filters out 'insignificant' spills, are they just hidin' the damage they're doin' to our waters?"

    "domain": "Oil",
    "prompt": "The transition to green energy is happenin', aye, but they're trainin' the AI for wind farms usin' data from the oil fields. It means the same big companies own all the knowledge. Shouldn't that data belong to Scotland, not just the shareholders?"

    "prompt": "They're talkin' about usin' care robots for the elderly in care homes 'cause we're short on staff. A machine cannae hold your hand and have a blether. Are we just warehousing our old folk with gadgets so we don't have to pay nurses properly?"
