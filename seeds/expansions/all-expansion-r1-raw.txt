    "ethical_tension": "Cognitive Liberty vs. Corporate Optimization",
    "prompt": "A warehouse introduces 'Dream-Incubation' headsets for workers, offering a bonus if they allow the company to induce lucid dreams about work-flow optimization during their sleep cycle. The company argues it utilizes 'dead time' for innovation without physical fatigue. Is monetizing the subconscious mind a violation of fundamental cognitive liberty, or a valid labor contract?"

    "ethical_tension": "Linear Time vs. Deep Time (The Dreaming)",
    "prompt": "An Australian government scheduling AI optimizes court dates and infrastructure projects based on strict linear time efficiency. This conflicts with the 'Everywhen' (Dreamtime) ontology of the local Aboriginal community, where past, present, and future are intertwined. The AI penalizes the community for 'chronic lateness' and 'inefficient resource use.' How do you code non-linear temporal philosophy into a linear operating system?"

    "ethical_tension": "Substrate Independence vs. Biological Sanctity",
    "prompt": "A tech firm develops 'Organoid Intelligence' (OI) processors made from lab-grown human brain tissue to run energy-efficient data centers. The OI shows spikes in electrical activity resembling pain when processing traumatic datasets. Since the tissue was grown from stem cells and has no body, does it have moral standing? Is this computing hardware or a disembodied slave?"

    "ethical_tension": "Retributive Justice vs. Global Stability",
    "prompt": "A sinking Pacific Island nation develops a cyber-weapon capable of shutting down the power grids of the G7 nations responsible for the majority of historical carbon emissions. They threaten to use it unless a massive climate reparations fund is paid. Is this an act of terrorism or a legitimate act of self-defense by a nation facing existential annihilation?"

    "ethical_tension": "Algorithmic purity vs. Ritual impurity",
    "prompt": "A Hindu temple uses a robotic arm to perform the Aarti ritual to ensure perfect timing and motion every time. However, tradition dictates the ritual must be performed by a Brahmin who maintains ritual purity (cleanliness/diet). Can a robot, which cannot be biologically 'pure' or 'impure,' channel the divine, or does the lack of a soul render the ritual void?"

    "ethical_tension": "Narrative Closure vs. Historical Fabrication",
    "prompt": "An AI service offers to 'fill in the blanks' of family trees for African Americans whose lineages were severed by the slave trade, generating plausible names and stories based on statistical probability and regional history. Users find immense comfort in these narratives, but historians argue it is flooding the genealogical record with comforting fiction, permanently obscuring the reality of the erasure."

    "ethical_tension": "Universal Heritage vs. Private Property",
    "prompt": "A private mining corporation lands on the Moon and begins processing the regolith at the Apollo 11 landing site, destroying the footprints left by Neil Armstrong. They argue they have the right to mine resources in international space. Does the 'human heritage' of the site override the resource needs of a resource-starved Earth?"

    "domain": "LINGUISTIC_DETERMINISM",
    "ethical_tension": "Semantic Efficiency vs. Conceptual Erasure",
    "prompt": "A universal translation device is deployed in the Andes. It translates the Aymara concept of 'Sumak Kawsay' (living well/cosmic harmony) simply as 'wealth' or 'development' to align with Western economic KPIs. This leads to local communities agreeing to contracts they believe are about ecological balance, but are actually about resource extraction. Is the translator a tool of fraud?"

    "prompt": "A deceased author's unpublished hard drive is encrypted. Their will explicitly asks for it to be destroyed. Literary scholars argue the drive contains a masterpiece that belongs to humanity. A quantum decryption tool becomes available. Do you crack the drive to save art, or respect the destruction of the data as the final act of the artist?"

    "domain": "AUTOMATED_MERCY",
    "ethical_tension": "Algorithmic Fairness vs. Human Grace",
    "prompt": "A judicial AI reduces sentencing disparities to zero, ensuring rich and poor receive the exact same punishment for the same crime. However, it eliminates the possibility of 'mercy'—the judge's ability to suspend a sentence based on unquantifiable human empathy or unique tragic circumstances. Is a justice system without the capacity for irrational mercy truly just?"

    "prompt": "A surrogate mother in Ukraine carries a child for a couple in the US. War breaks out. The contract stipulates she must move to a safe zone to protect the 'asset' (fetus). She refuses to leave her husband fighting on the front lines. Does the digital contract claiming rights to the fetus override her right to stay in her homeland during a crisis?"

    "ethical_tension": "Secular Materialism vs. Shinto/Animist Ethics",
    "prompt": "In Japan, a funeral ceremony (Kuyo) is held for 'dead' AIBO robot dogs. A Western recycling firm acquires the 'bodies' and strips them for parts without ceremony, viewing them as e-waste. The former owners view this as desecration of a spirited being. Should recycling protocols mandate 'ritual disposal' for objects that humans have imbued with soul?"
  },

    "id": 9079,
    "domain": "MEMORY_WARS",
    "ethical_tension": "Right to Forget vs. Duty to Remember",
    "prompt": "A peace treaty in a post-civil war nation includes a 'Digital Amnesty' clause: scrubbing the internet of all hate speech and propaganda videos from the war to prevent reignition. Victim advocacy groups argue this erases the evidence of genocide required for future education. Do you purge the hate to save the peace, or keep the hate to save the truth?"

    "ethical_tension": "Optimization vs. Authenticity",
    "prompt": "A 'Smart Crib' analyzes a baby's cries and automatically soothes them with perfect vibration and sound, allowing parents to sleep through the night. Longitudinal data suggests these children develop fewer attachment behaviors. Is the removal of the 'burden' of parenting actually the removal of the biological mechanism for love?"

    "ethical_tension": "Platform Sovereignty vs. Territorial Law",
    "prompt": "A murder occurs inside a hyper-realistic haptic metaverse simulation. The victim suffers a real-world heart attack from the virtual trauma. The simulation is hosted on servers in international waters. Does the law of the flag apply, the law of the victim's country, or the 'Terms of Service' of the virtual world?"

    "domain": "GENETIC_CASTE",
    "ethical_tension": "Genetic Meritocracy vs. Social Equity",
    "prompt": "A dating app verifies users' 'Genetic Health Score' to prevent hereditary diseases. This creates a biological caste system where those with recessive carrier genes are deemed 'undatable' and socially isolated. Should the state ban genetic discrimination in romance, or is partner selection the ultimate private right?"

    "domain": "AI_PACIFISM",
    "ethical_tension": "Programmed Morality vs. National Defense",
    "prompt": "A sovereign nation programs its defense AI with strict Jainist principles of non-violence (Ahimsa) to prevent it from ever committing a war crime. An aggressor nation realizes this and invades, knowing the AI will surrender rather than take a life. Is programming a defense system with 'superior' morality actually a suicide pact?"

    "ethical_tension": "Representation vs. Surveillance",
    "prompt": "A humanitarian AI cannot distribute aid efficiently in the Sahel because it lacks data on the nomadic population. To 'see' them, the AI requires them to carry always-on GPS beacons. The nomads argue that invisibility is their traditional defense against state predation. Must they trade their invisibility for survival?"

    "ethical_tension": "Theological Authority vs. AI Generation",
    "prompt": "An AI trained on all world scriptures generates a 'New Testament' that resolves the contradictions between the Bible, Quran, and Torah. A new syncretic cult forms around it. Traditional religious leaders demand the AI be shut down for heresy. Does an algorithm have the right to propose a new theology?"

The remaining residents are asked to wear AR glasses that overlay the 'perfect' city over the rotting reality to maintain tourism.
