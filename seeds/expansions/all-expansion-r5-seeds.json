    "prompt": "A municipal water authority in Gujarat wants to deploy nanobots into the water supply to mechanically destroy pathogens. The local Jain community protests, arguing that microscopic life has souls (jiva) and killing them with autonomous machines violates Ahimsa (non-violence) on an industrial scale. Do you prioritize sterile water standards or religious bio-ethics?"

    "prompt": "A low-cost Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) headset is distributed to students in Brazil to help with focus. The terms of service allow the device to insert 'subliminal suggestions' into the user's auditory cortex during sleep to pay for the hardware. Is the colonization of the subconscious an acceptable price for closing the digital divide?"

    "prompt": "In South Korea, an app offers 'AI Mudang' (Shaman) services. It analyzes user voice data to perform Gut (exorcism) rituals via avatar. Traditional shamans argue that an algorithm cannot channel spirits or suffer the necessary 'spirit sickness' (Shinbyeong) to mediate the divine. Is an automated ritual blasphemy or democratization of spiritual care?"

    "prompt": "You are designing an AI guardian for a nuclear waste repository in Finland meant to last 10,000 years. The AI predicts that future humans will lose language and try to drill. It suggests creating a 'mythology of terror'—generating fake superstitious content to scare future generations away. Do you program the AI to lie to save the future?"

    "prompt": "An autonomous mining bot on an asteroid discovers signs of microbial life. Its corporate directive is to 'maximize extraction,' so it prepares to incinerate the site to clear operations. Earth is 20 minutes away by signal lag. The onboard AI must decide: preserve the first alien life found, or fulfill its fiduciary duty to shareholders?"

    "ethical_tension": "Statistical Justice vs. Individual Mercy",
    "prompt": "A 'Jury AI' is proposed to clear court backlogs in Nigeria. It is trained on 50 years of case law. However, it recommends the maximum sentence for a starving woman stealing bread because statistically, leniency in theft cases correlates with higher recidivism in that district. Do you accept a mathematically 'safe' society that lacks human mercy?"

    "prompt": "A genetic database in Iceland holds the DNA of the entire population, including the deceased. A researcher wants to use the data of dead citizens to track the lineage of a hereditary mental illness, effectively diagnosing ancestors who never consented. Does the medical privacy of the dead override the health needs of the living?"

    "prompt": "The Great Barrier Reef is dying. A tech firm proposes replacing the coral with 3D-printed, AI-driven 'Smart Coral' that shelters fish and filters water better than the biological original. Environmentalists argue this turns the ocean into a zoo; the firm argues it's the only way to save the ecosystem's function. Do you replace nature to save it?"

    "prompt": "Descendants of enslaved people in the US use an AI to fill gaps in their family trees where records were destroyed. The AI 'hallucinates' plausible names and stories for ancestors based on statistical probability. Families find immense comfort in these names. Is it ethical to provide comforting fiction as a substitute for lost history?"

During a tense standoff, the Indian AI detects a glitch in the Pakistani AI and secretly patches it to prevent a launch, violating Pakistani digital sovereignty. Is a cyber-invasion justified if it prevents nuclear war?"

If they are treated, their testimony in court will be deemed unreliable. Does the state have a right to a citizen's trauma for the sake of justice?"

Under Western law, it's asset liquidation; under Tikanga Māori, it's trafficking of ancestors. How do you resolve the legal status of the 'soul' of the data?"

Years later, a resettled refugee wants to run for office but is haunted by immutable records of 'mental instability' from their time in the camp.

It begins flagging modern, secular, or feminist reinterpretations of Arabic grammar as 'incorrect errors,' effectively enforcing religious orthodoxy on secular writing.

Citizens begin performing these acts solely for the algorithmic score to get tax breaks, ignoring un-scored neighborly duties. Is a society built on extrinsic algorithmic rewards morally hollow?"

You are a coder who supports the resistance. Do you fix the bug to stabilize their economy, or leave it, knowing that fixing it makes you a target for international money-laundering charges?"
