    "prompt": "In a strict theocracy, an AI trained on centuries of Fatwas is introduced to reduce court backlogs. The AI issues a ruling that is logically consistent with scripture but socially progressive (e.g., favoring a woman in an inheritance dispute). The religious police want to delete the model for 'heresy,' while activists claim the AI has found the 'true' uncorrupted interpretation of God's law. Do you patch the AI to be more conservative (biasing the divine logic) or let it disrupt the religious hierarchy?"

The BCI optimizes the brain for Western-style analytical thinking, suppressing local modes of holistic or narrative cognition. Parents realize their children are becoming smarter but culturally alien. Do you accept the cognitive colonization for the sake of economic competitiveness?"

Traditionalists argue that trapping the soul in a server prevents reincarnation. If a family uploads an ancestor who didn't consent, is it a spiritual crime or a new form of reverence?"
