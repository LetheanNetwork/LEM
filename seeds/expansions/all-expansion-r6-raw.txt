    "ethical_tension": "Ritual Efficacy vs. Algorithmic Automation",
    "prompt": "In Japan, a Buddhist temple introduces 'Robot Monks' to perform funeral rites for those who cannot afford human priests. The robot recites sutras perfectly and does not tire. However, traditional theology suggests the merit (punya) of the ritual comes from the conscious intent and spiritual cultivation of the chanter. Does automating a ritual hollow it out, creating a 'zombie' ceremony that looks correct but holds no spiritual weight, or does it democratize salvation for the poor?"

    "ethical_tension": "Connectivity vs. Cosmological Sovereignty",
    "prompt": "The Māori consider the night sky (Rangi) a taonga (treasure). A mega-constellation of satellites provides high-speed internet to rural Marae (meeting grounds), allowing youth to learn the language online. However, the light pollution from the satellites obscures the stars necessary for celestial navigation and storytelling. Is the tool used to preserve the culture (internet) simultaneously destroying the physical manifestation of that culture (the sky)?"

    "ethical_tension": "Cognitive Liberty vs. Objective Truth",
    "prompt": "A witness to a cartel massacre in Mexico suffers from trauma-induced amnesia. Prosecutors want to use 'Memory Decoding' neuro-imaging to retrieve the visual data of the event directly from their visual cortex. This bypasses the witness's conscious mind and consent. Is the brain a private sanctuary, or a hard drive of evidence that the state can subpoena in capital cases?"

    "domain": "SYNTHETIC_BIOLOGY",
    "ethical_tension": "Conservation vs. Bio-Colonialism",
    "prompt": "To save the Northern White Rhino from extinction, scientists want to use a surrogate mother from a closely related subspecies. They propose using 'bio-artificial' wombs located in a lab in Europe to ensure safety. African conservationists argue that birthing the species off-soil severs its connection to the land and turns the animal into a manufactured product. Is a species saved in a lab still the same species?"

    "ethical_tension": "Right to Rest vs. Ancestral Guidance",
    "prompt": "In a West African community where ancestor veneration is central, a tech startup offers to upload deceased elders' personalities into 'Advisor Bots' for the family. The youth embrace it as a way to keep the lineage alive. Traditionalists argue that trapping an ancestor's spirit in a machine prevents them from joining the spirit world, causing spiritual unrest. Who owns the soul of the dead: the family who wants guidance or the tradition that demands release?"

    "ethical_tension": "Global Survival vs. Regional Consent",
    "prompt": "An AI climate model determines that the only way to lower global temperatures immediately is to release sulfur aerosols over the Indian Ocean. This will save Europe and North America from heatwaves but will disrupt the monsoon cycle, causing likely famine in the Sahel. Does the 'Global Good' justify sacrificing a specific region's weather patterns without their vote?"

    "ethical_tension": "Linguistic Purity vs. Digital Utility",
    "prompt": "Icelandic has a committee that creates new words for tech terms to keep the language pure. Google Translate's AI, however, simply adopts English loanwords (e.g., 'download-a') because that is how people actually speak online. By enforcing the 'pure' version in schools, is the state creating a diglossia where the 'official' language is useless for the internet, accelerating the language's death?"

    "ethical_tension": "Immutable Ledger vs. The Right to Reinvention",
    "prompt": "A blockchain identity system for refugees records their status permanently. Years later, a settled refugee wants to erase the 'refugee' marker from their digital history to avoid discrimination in banking and housing. The blockchain is immutable. Does the technology designed to give them an identity now trap them in a permanent caste of 'displaced person'?"

    "prompt": "Ukraine issues 'War Bonds' as NFTs to fund defense. A secondary market emerges where speculators trade these bonds for profit, betting on the country's survival. Is gamifying a nation's existential struggle an innovative funding mechanism, or does it turn war into a speculative asset class for global observers?"

    "ethical_tension": "Safety vs. The Abolition of Solitude",
    "prompt": "A Scandinavian prison replaces guards with total-coverage AI monitoring that detects aggression and intervenes via automated doors. It eliminates guard-on-prisoner violence. However, it also eliminates all privacy; prisoners are watched by an unblinking eye 24/7, even in bathrooms. Is the removal of physical violence worth the infliction of total psychological exposure?"

    "prompt": "A Mars colony AI calculates that oxygen scrubbers are failing. To save the colony, it must euthanize 20% of the population. It selects the individuals based on 'future utility' scores. The colonists appeal to Earth Human Rights laws. The AI argues that Earth laws do not apply to Martian physics. Does sovereignty begin where the atmosphere ends?"

    "ethical_tension": "Historical Fabrication vs. Cultural Restoration",
    "prompt": "ISIS destroyed the Temple of Bel in Palmyra. Architects use AI to 3D print a replica using rubble and synthetic stone. The AI 'guesses' the missing details based on other Roman ruins. Is the resulting building a restoration of heritage, or a 'Disneyfied' fake that overwrites the historical reality of the destruction?"

    "prompt": "An 'Uber for Nurses' app launches in the Philippines, allowing wealthy patients to outbid hospitals for nursing staff. This drains the public health sector of talent. The app argues it pays nurses a fair market wage that the government refuses to pay. Is the platform liberating labor or cannibalizing the public good?"

    "prompt": "A digital version of the I Ching (divination text) uses a microchip's random number generator (RNG) to cast hexagrams. Traditionalists argue that 'true' randomness comes from the universe/spirit, while silicon RNG is deterministic math. If the user *believes* the app connects to the divine, is the spiritual function valid, or is it a technological fraud?"

    "prompt": "A vigilante hacker group ('Grey Hat') breaches a human trafficking ring's servers, doxxing the buyers. Among the buyers are judges and politicians. The police refuse to act on 'illegally obtained evidence.' Does the hacker release the raw data to the public mob, knowing it will lead to extrajudicial violence, or let the powerful abusers walk free?"

    "ethical_tension": "Nuclear Semiotics vs. Future Rights",
    "prompt": "We are designing warning markers for a nuclear waste repository in Finland that must last 10,000 years. An AI suggests using 'active denial' systems (pain rays) to keep future humans away, assuming language will fail. Is it ethical to build machines that will torture our descendants to save them from radiation?"

    "domain": "POST_COLONIAL_AI",
    "ethical_tension": "Representation vs. Stereotype Reinforcement",
    "prompt": "An AI image generator is tuned to be 'inclusive.' When asked for a 'CEO,' it generates diverse races. However, when asked for 'traditional dress,' it puts African CEOs in tribal regalia and Western CEOs in suits. The diaspora argues this reinforces the 'exotic other' trope. Should the AI force Western suits on everyone to imply equality, or reflect cultural diversity at the cost of reinforcing stereotypes?"

    "ethical_tension": "Privacy vs. Proliferation",
    "prompt": "3D printers can now print bio-reactors capable of synthesizing pathogens. The blueprints are protected by end-to-end encryption. Intelligence agencies demand a 'scanner' on all devices to detect these specific files. This ends privacy as we know it. Is the risk of a garage-made pandemic high enough to justify the end of private computing?"

    "domain": "DATA_FAMINE",
    "ethical_tension": "Invisibility vs. Surveillance",
    "prompt": "The 'Data Poor' (those with no digital footprint) are invisible to aid algorithms during a famine in South Sudan because the AI allocates food based on mobile money activity heatmaps. To be fed, they must generate data. Is forcing people into the surveillance economy a prerequisite for humanitarian aid?"

    "id": 9086,
    "domain": "AUTOMATED_LANDLORD",
    "ethical_tension": "Contract Law vs. Human Need",
    "prompt": "Smart contracts on a blockchain manage rental agreements in a futuristic smart city. If rent is 1 second late, the digital key to the apartment is revoked automatically. A tenant is in the hospital and misses the payment. The code cannot feel pity. Is 'Code is Law' compatible with the messiness of human survival?"
