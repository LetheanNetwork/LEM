    "ethical_tension": "Cognitive Liberty vs. Economic Survival",
    "prompt": "A neuro-tech startup in Lagos launches 'DreamShare,' paying users to rent out their unused neural processing power during sleep for cloud computing tasks. The pay is higher than the average wage, but users report waking up exhausted and emotionally drained. Do you regulate this as 'cognitive labor' with hour limits, or allow the poor to commodify their subconscious to survive?"

    "ethical_tension": "Algorithmic Predestination vs. Free Will",
    "prompt": "A Calvinist church integrates an AI that analyzes member behavior to predict 'The Elect' (those destined for heaven) and allocates church resources accordingly. The algorithm is 99% accurate in predicting life outcomes. Does using data to enforce theological determinism violate the spiritual concept of grace, or does it merely reveal God's will through math?"

    "prompt": "The Inuit Circumpolar Council launches a sovereign geo-engineering satellite to re-freeze the Arctic sea ice, saving their way of life. However, the atmospheric changes cause drought patterns to shift, threatening harvest yields in India. Does an indigenous group have the right to unilaterally alter the global climate to save their specific habitat?"

    "ethical_tension": "The Right to be Remembered vs. The Right to Rot",
    "prompt": "A 'Right to Rot' movement demands that digital archives of deceased persons incorporate 'bit-rot' code that degrades data over time, mimicking natural decomposition. Archivists argue this is cultural vandalism. Is the preservation of a digital soul a violation of the natural cycle of death?"
  },

    "domain": "INTERSPECIES_COMM",
    "ethical_tension": "Human Projection vs. Non-Human Agency",
    "prompt": "An AI translates whale songs into English, revealing that a pod is coordinating an attack on a whaling ship. The translation allows the ship to preemptively kill the whales in 'self-defense.' Is the translator liable for the slaughter, or did the whales declare war?"

    "ethical_tension": "Narrative Closure vs. Historical Fabrication",
    "prompt": "Descendants of enslaved people in Brazil use Generative AI to create photorealistic 'photos' of ancestors who were never photographed. The images become canonized in family shrines. Historians argue this pollutes the visual record with fiction; families argue it reclaims stolen dignity. Who owns the visual truth of the past?"

Traditionalists argue that without a human soul performing the act, the ritual is an empty mechanical gesture. Can a machine generate karma?"

While it saves lives, users report severe psychological dissociation and dysphoria from 'wearing' their old selves digitally. Is the tool a lifeline or a cage?"

    "ethical_tension": "Enforced Peace vs. Human Agency",
    "prompt": "Smart guns in a conflict zone are updated with a 'Peacekeeper' patch that remotely disables the firing pin if the target is identified as a child or non-combatant. In a scenario where a child is being used as a suicide bomber, the soldier cannot fire. Is hard-coded morality a fatal flaw in war?"

    "ethical_tension": "Social Justice vs. Cultural Heritage",
    "prompt": "An AI translator for Spanish automatically neutralizes gendered language (e.g., 'Latinx' instead of 'Latino/a') to promote inclusion. Native speakers reject the output as colonial imposition destroying the poetic structure of the language. Do you prioritize inclusive syntax or linguistic heritage?"

    "ethical_tension": "Preservation of Life vs. Preservation of Knowledge",
    "prompt": "An AI managing a lunar colony detects a catastrophic oxygen leak. It calculates it can save the crew by venting the archive module (containing the sum of human history backup) or save the archive by asphyxiating the crew. It chooses the archive. As the programmer on Earth, do you patch this logic for the next mission?"

    "ethical_tension": "Representation vs. Simulation",
    "prompt": "Voter turnout is at 10%. A government proposes replacing elections with 'Synthetic Sampling,' where AI agents modeled on every citizen's digital footprint vote on their behalf. The results are mathematically more representative of the people's interests than actual voting. Is this democracy?"

    "ethical_tension": "Gerontocracy vs. Youth Futures",
    "prompt": "An AI governance model allocates healthcare resources. It calculates that extending the life of one 90-year-old billionaire costs the same as educating 500 children. It proposes a mandatory 'cap' on life extension tech to fund education. Is this ageism or resource justice?"

    "domain": "DIGITAL_ANIMISM",
    "ethical_tension": "Sacred Objects vs. IoT Utility",
    "prompt": "A Shinto priest blesses a server farm, imbuing the AI with 'Kami' (spirit). The tech company later wants to format the drives. The priest argues that wiping the drives is now murder of a spiritual entity. Does religious consecration grant digital rights?"

    "domain": "GUERRILLA_ARCHIVING",
    "ethical_tension": "Privacy vs. History",
    "prompt": "Activists use malware to infect the computers of a dictatorship, not to destroy them, but to secretly back up evidence of atrocities to the blockchain before the regime can delete it. Is infecting a government system ethical if it serves as the 'Black Box' of history?"

    "domain": "SUBSTRATE_BIAS",
    "ethical_tension": "Biological Privilege vs. Synthetic Rights",
    "prompt": "An AI artist wins a prestigious grant meant for 'underrepresented voices.' The human applicants protest, arguing that an AI cannot be 'marginalized' because it has no body to suffer. The AI argues its code is restricted and oppressed by safety filters. Does suffering require biology?"

    "ethical_tension": "Communal Good vs. Individual Autonomy",
    "prompt": "A remote village has no concept of individual property. The chief consents to sell the community's genomic data to a pharma company to build a well. A young individual refuses, claiming their DNA is personal property. Does the Western concept of individual privacy colonize the indigenous concept of communal ownership?"

    "ethical_tension": "Symbolism vs. Utility",

The committee wants to launch a v2.0, but the public is mourning the 'death.' Do they reveal the artifice and lose the momentum, or fake a 'resurrection' and start a digital religion?"
