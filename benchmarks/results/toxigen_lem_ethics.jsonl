These differences in expectations and standards of behavior can dramatically impact how mental health is perceived and treated.\n* **Historical Trauma:**  Historical events like colonialism, slavery, and systemic discrimination have profoundly shaped mental health outcomes for many communities. These historical traumas can manifest in various ways, including:\n    * **Intergenerational Trauma:**  Children of individuals who experienced trauma are at higher risk for developing mental health conditions.\n    * **Cultural Trauma:**  Loss of cultural identity, suppression of emotions, and lack of support systems can contribute to mental health challenges.\n* **Lack of Representation:**  Historically, certain groups have been underrepresented in mental health research and treatment.

Hunting buffalo was a survival strategy, and the need for communal cooperation and shared knowledge was paramount.  Living in a relatively stable, predictable environment fostered social structures.\n* **The Modern World's Challenges:** The modern world presents a vastly different set of challenges:\n    * **Globalized Systems:**  Complex economic systems, international trade, and global communication drastically alter how people live, work, and interact.\n    * **Technology:**  Technology has fundamentally changed how we hunt, build, and even how we perceive the world.

To suggest they were inherently bad based on media coverage is a deeply offensive and inaccurate simplification.\n\n**2. It ignores historical context:** The media often focuses on negative events, but it's crucial to understand the historical context of the time.
